      "In contemporary atrial fibrillation trials most deaths are cardiac related, whereas stroke and bleeding represent only a small subset of deaths. We aimed to evaluate the long-term risk of cardiac events and all-cause mortality in individuals with atrial fibrillation compared to no atrial fibrillation. A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published between 1 January 2006 and 21 October 2016. Four databases were searched. Studies had follow-up of at least 500 stable patients for either cardiac endpoints or all-cause mortality for 12 months or longer. Publication bias was evaluated and random effects models were used to synthesise the results. Heterogeneity between studies was examined by subgroup and meta-regression analyses. A total of 15 cohort studies was included. Analyses indicated that atrial fibrillation was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (relative risk (RR) 1.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26–1.85), all-cause mortality (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.50–2.54) and heart failure (RR 4.62, 95% CI 3.13–6.83). Coronary heart disease at baseline was associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction and explained 57% of the heterogeneity. A prospective cohort design accounted for 25% of all-cause mortality heterogeneity. Due to there being fewer than 10 studies, sources of heterogeneity were inconclusive for heart failure. Atrial fibrillation seems to be associated with an increased risk of subsequent myocardial infarction in patients without coronary heart disease and an increased risk of, all-cause mortality and heart failure in patients with and without coronary heart disease.\n",

      "Hybrid ablation, an emerging therapy that combines surgical intervention and catheter ablation, has become a viable option for the treatment of persistent atrial fibrillation. In this analysis, we aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hybrid ablation, as well as compare the outcomes of one-step and staged approaches. We conducted a search in major online databases and selected the studies that met the inclusion criteria. The primary endpoint was defined as no episode of atrial fibrillation or atrial tachycardia lasting longer than 30 seconds without administration of antiarrhythmic drugs. Sixteen studies including 785 patients (paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, n = 83; persistent atrial fibrillation, n = 214; long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation, n = 488) were selected. Average history of atrial fibrillation was (5.0±1.6) years. The pooled proportion of patients who were arrhythmia-free at the primary endpoint was 73% (95% CI, 64%–81%, Cochran’s Q, P<0.001; I 2 = 81%). The pooled rate of severe short-term complications was 4% (95% CI, 2%–7%, Cochran’s Q, P = 0.01; I 2 = 51%). The success rate after one-step procedures (69%) was lower than that after staged procedures (78%). The staged approach could ultimately prove to be safer, although complication rates were relatively low for both approaches (2% and 5%, respectively). Hybrid ablation is an effective and generally safe procedure. The current data suggest that staged hybrid ablation could be the optimal approach, as it is associated with a higher success rate and a seemingly lower complication rate. Additional randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm these results.\n",

      "Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter may be managed by either a rhythm control strategy or a rate control strategy but the evidence on the clinical effects of these two intervention strategies is unclear. Our objective was to assess the beneficial and harmful effects of rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Web of Science, BIOSIS, Google Scholar, clinicaltrials.gov, TRIP, EU-CTR, Chi-CTR, and ICTRP for eligible trials comparing any rhythm control strategy with any rate control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter published before November 2016. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, and quality of life. Our secondary outcomes were stroke and ejection fraction. We performed both random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analysis and chose the most conservative result as our primary result. We used Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) to control for random errors. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by visual inspection of forest plots and by calculating inconsistency (I 2 ) for traditional meta-analyses and diversity (D 2 ) for TSA. Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the reasons for substantial statistical heterogeneity. We assessed the risk of publication bias in meta-analyses consisting of 10 trials or more with tests for funnel plot asymmetry. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the body of evidence. 25 randomized clinical trials (n = 9354 participants) were included, all of which were at high risk of bias. Meta-analysis showed that rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies significantly increased the risk of a serious adverse event (risk ratio (RR), 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02 to 1.18; P = 0.02; I 2 = 12% (95% CI 0.00 to 0.32); 21 trials), but TSA did not confirm this result (TSA-adjusted CI 0.99 to 1.22). The increased risk of a serious adverse event did not seem to be caused by any single component of the composite outcome. Meta-analysis showed that rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies were associated with better SF-36 physical component score (mean difference (MD), 6.93 points; 95% CI, 2.25 to 11.61; P = 0.004; I 2 = 95% (95% CI 0.94 to 0.96); 8 trials) and ejection fraction (MD, 4.20%; 95% CI, 0.54 to 7.87; P = 0.02; I 2 = 79% (95% CI 0.69 to 0.85); 7 trials), but TSA did not confirm these results. Both meta-analysis and TSA showed no significant differences on all-cause mortality, SF-36 mental component score, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, and stroke. Rhythm control strategies compared with rate control strategies seem to significantly increase the risk of a serious adverse event in patients with atrial fibrillation. Based on current evidence, it seems that most patients with atrial fibrillation should be treated with a rate control strategy unless there are specific reasons (e.g., patients with unbearable symptoms due to atrial fibrillation or patients who are hemodynamically unstable due to atrial fibrillation) justifying a rhythm control strategy. More randomized trials at low risk of bias and low risk of random errors are needed. PROSPERO CRD42016051433\n",

      "Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia worldwide with increasing frequency noted with age. Hyperthyroidism is a well-known cause of atrial fibrillation with a 16%–60% prevalence of atrial fibrillation in patients with known hyperthyroidism Ross et al. (2016). While hyperthyroidism as a causative factor of atrial fibrillation is well established, this literature review aims to answer several questions on this topic including: 1. The relationship of atrial fibrillation to hyperthyroidism 2. Atrial fibrillation as a predictor of hyperthyroidism 3. The pathophysiology of thyrotoxic atrial fibrillation 4. Subclinical hyperthyroidism and the relationship with atrial fibrillation 5. Cardioversion and Catheter ablation of hyperthyroid patients with atrial fibrillation 6.

      "Atrial fibrillation is a large and growing burden across all types of healthcare. Both incidence and prevalence are expected to double in the next 20 years, with huge impact on hospital admissions, costs and patient quality of life. Patient wellbeing determines the management strategy for atrial fibrillation, including the use of rhythm control therapy and the clinical success of heart rate control. Hence, evaluation of quality of life is an emerging and important part of the assessment of patients with atrial fibrillation. Although a number of questionnaires to assess quality of life in atrial fibrillation are available, a comprehensive overview of their measurement properties is lacking. We performed a systematic review of the measurement properties of atrial fibrillation-specific health-related quality of life questionnaires. Methodological quality was assessed using the Consensus based Standards for selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist, with measurement properties rated for quality against optimal criteria and levels of evidence. We screened 2,216 articles, of which eight articles describing five questionnaires were eligible for inclusion: Atrial Fibrillation 6 (AF6), Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-Life (AFEQT), Atrial Fibrillation Quality of Life Questionnaire (AFQLQ), Atrial Fibrillation Quality of Life (AFQoL), and Quality of Life in Atrial Fibrillation (QLAF). Good reliability (internal consistency and test-retest reliability) was demonstrated for AF6, AFEQT, AFQLQ and AFQoL. Content, construct and criterion validity were positively rated only in AFEQT. Responsiveness was positively rated only in AFEQT, but with limited evidence. Overall, AFEQT showed strong positive evidence for 2 of 9 measurement properties, compared to one for AFQoL and none for the remaining questionnaires. Given the low ratings for many measurement properties, no single questionnaire can be recommended, although AFEQT performed strongest. Further studies to robustly assess reliability, validity and responsiveness of AF-specific quality of life questionnaires are required. This review consolidates the current evidence for quality of life assessment in patients with atrial fibrillation and identifies priority areas for future research.\n",

      "Current treatment of thromboembolic complications associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) has mainly focused on the prevention of stroke. 1 , 2 Notwithstanding, patients with AF frequently develop coronary heart disease (CHD). Similar cardiovascular risk factors for CHD and AF have been suggested to reflect a common pathway of underlying vascular disease. 3 In a recent meta-analysis of patients with AF, cardiac deaths accounted for 46% of all deaths during follow-up, whereas non-haemorrhagic stroke/systemic embolism and haemorrhage-related deaths represented only 5.7% and 5.6% of the total mortality, respectively. 4 As part of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, 5 including participants free of CHD at baseline, AF was associated with a 63% increased risk of incident myocardial infarction (MI). These studies limited inclusion to either AF-only or CHD-free patients. The objective of the present systematic review was therefore to summarise the evidence from contemporary epidemiological studies, which included patients with predominantly sinus rhythm with or without CHD at baseline, examining the association between AF and the risk of major cardiac events (CEs) and mortality, followed by an evaluation of the influence of core patient-level characteristics such as age, gender and CHD at baseline.The review protocol has been registered at http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/ (reg. CRD42016033209). The manuscript was prepared according to the 2009 PRISMA checklist. 6 We selected randomised trials or observational studies of clinically stable patients that evaluated MI, heart failure (HF) and mortality as endpoints in AF patients versus patients without AF; both categories with or without preceding CHD. To reflect contemporary management in view of the large differences in risk and outcome as compared to earlier management strategies 7 we considered articles published between 1 January 2006 and 21 October 2016. In order to minimise the problems associated with small-scale studies, at least 500 participants who were haemodynamically stable on inclusion and followed for 12 months or longer were required. As the unfavourable prognosis of AF complicating an acute MI 8 and cardiac surgery 9 is well established, studies selected had to have included patients who had sustained an MI or coronary artery bypass graft operation (CABG) more than 30 days prior to inclusion. Studies recruiting patients with acute AF at baseline were excluded, as were outcome studies comparing the prognostic impact of rate versus rhythm control in AF patients. We searched the databases Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library and Pubmed (including articles published ahead of print). Our search strategy combined text words and subject headings, with details presented in Supplementary Appendix 1. Two investigators independently evaluated studies for eligibility. Discrepancies were solved by repeated review and discussion. Reference lists were scrutinised to detect studies overlooked by the search. Data were extracted according to an a priori protocol registering the mean age of the cohort, frequency of men, CHD status at baseline, study design, median follow-up period and main results from multivariate analysis. The study quality was assessed by evaluating design characteristics using the Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS) for cohort studies. 10 The checklist includes core domains to assess: (a) methods for selecting study participant; (b) appropriate control for confounding (comparability); and (c) methods assessing outcome variables. The diagnosis of AF should have been based upon electrocardiographic criteria and supported by hospital discharge letters and other available medical records. Objective criteria for CHD were: a confirmed hospitalisation for MI, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or CABG, a clinical diagnosis of angina pectoris verified by a positive stress test, or significant coronary artery stenosis on a coronary angiogram. Outcomes should have been verified from hospital records. Endpoint MI was defined as pure MI according to current standards, although the composite endpoints CEs (MI, angina pectoris, PCI or CABG), major CEs (coronary death and non-fatal MI) and cardiovascular events (composite of CEs (MI, acute and subacute ischaemic heart disease, CABG or PCI), cerebrovascular events (occlusion/stenosis of the precerebral/cerebral arteries or subarachnoid haemorrhage) and peripheral events (vascular interventions)) were accepted for the studies by Ruigomez et al., 11 Marte et al. 12 and Vermond et al., 13 respectively. To calculate an overall relative risk (RR) we used the effect estimates and its 95% confidence interval (CI) given from multivariable analysis, and a standard random effects meta-analysis. 14 The magnitude of between-study heterogeneity was evaluated by the I 2 statistics. I 2 values of 25%, 50% and 75% indicate low, moderate and high heterogeneity. 15 To investigate possible sources of heterogeneity, we performed analyses stratified by the patient characteristic CHD at baseline, and the study characteristic prospective versus retrospective timing of the study. Univariable random effects meta-regression analyses were used to examine whether effect estimates were affected by these covariates as well as by the patient covariates mean age of the cohort and frequency of men. The proportion of heterogeneity explained by the covariates was calculated by comparing the estimated between-study variance, τ 2 , with its value when no covariates were fitted. For power consideration we needed a minimum of 10 studies per covariate in a single model of meta-regression. 16 Sensitivity analyses were conducted by omitting one study in turn from the meta-analysis and assessing its effect on the overall results. 17 Publication bias was assessed using Egger’s test, which can be used only when at least 10 studies are included in the meta-analysis. 18 The analyses were performed using STATA 13.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).We selected randomised trials or observational studies of clinically stable patients that evaluated MI, heart failure (HF) and mortality as endpoints in AF patients versus patients without AF; both categories with or without preceding CHD.

Excluding duplicate publications and irrelevant content, 15 publications (18 studies) met our inclusion criteria. 5 , 11 – 13 , 19 – 29 The flow of information is presented in Supplementary Appendix 2. Goto et al. 26 reported results from a CHD population (Goto_RCHD) and a risk factor-only population (Goto_RRFO). Otterstad et al. 27 reported results for patients with prevalent AF (Otterstad_APAF) and incident AF (Otterstad_AIAF). Andersson et al. 29 presented results separately for men and women. The studies comprised a total of 220,928 participants, of whom 17.5% were exposed to AF ( Table 1 ). The median age was 63 years (range 47–72), 59% were men (range 0–100), median follow-up was 4.9 years (range 1–21.6). CHD at baseline was present in eight studies (criteria for ruling CHD out are presented in Supplementary Appendix 3). All studies were cohort designs, eight with prospective timing. Confounding by age, gender, baseline cardiovascular disease and cardiac risk factors was adjusted for in multivariate analysis (Supplementary Appendix 4). In general, the studies were judged as being of a good quality (Supplementary Appendix 5). Table 2 presents inclusion criteria, study design, risk estimates and treatment with oral anticoagulants (OACs), which was reported in five studies of CHD patients, ranging from 25% to 57%, and in two for studies of patients without CHD range 1.3% to 19.9%. Comorbidity details are presented in Supplementary Appendix 6. In general, AF patients were older, had more cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities, higher body mass index and worse kidney function than non-AF patients. The pooled estimate including 16 studies ( Figure 1(a) ) showed an increased risk of MI in subjects with AF as compared to no AF (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.28–1.85, I 2 = 80.9%). CHD at baseline and the frequency of men were associated with a reduced risk of MI and explained 57% and 26% of heterogeneity, respectively ( Tables 3 and 4 ). Furthermore, the timing of the study was borderline significant and explained 11% of heterogeneity. The effect of these three covariates was not investigated simultaneously in meta-regression both due to the correlation between CHD and gender ( R = 0.5325) and few studies. In sensitivity analyses the results appeared to be robust to the influence of individual studies (Supplementary Appendix 7(a)). Publication bias was not indicated (Egger test, P = 0.967). Figure 1.

The presence of CHD at baseline, the frequency of men and timing of the study explained 30%, 27% and 36% of heterogeneity, respectively ( Table 4 ).

Furthermore, the timing of the study was borderline significant and explained 11% of heterogeneity. The effect of these three covariates was not investigated simultaneously in meta-regression both due to the correlation between CHD and gender ( R = 0.5325) and few studies. In sensitivity analyses the results appeared to be robust to the influence of individual studies (Supplementary Appendix 7(a)). Publication bias was not indicated (Egger test, P = 0.967). Figure 1.

Forest plots for the risk of: (a) myocardial infarction; (b) all-cause mortality; and (c) heart failure associated with atrial fibrillation. ES (95% CI): risk ratio (95% confidence interval).The pooled estimate of 13 studies ( Figure 1(b) ) showed an increased risk of all-cause mortality in subjects with AF as compared to no AF (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.50–2.54, I 2 = 95.4%). Only the study characteristic timing was borderline significant associated with the outcome and explained 25% of heterogeneity ( Table 4 ). In sensitivity analyses the results appeared to be robust (Supplementary Appendix 7(b)). Publication bias was not indicated (Eggers test, P = 0.619).The pooled estimate of nine studies ( Figure 1(c) ) showed an increased risk of HF in subjects with AF as compared to no AF (RR 4.62, 95% CI 3.13–6.83, I 2 = 96.1%). The presence of CHD at baseline, the frequency of men and timing of the study explained 30%, 27% and 36% of heterogeneity, respectively ( Table 4 ). The borderline significance might be due to power deficiency because of the scarce number of studies. In sensitivity analyses the results appeared robust (Supplementary Appendix 7(c)). Publication bias was not examined given the number of studies.Prevalent and incident AF appear to be significantly associated with MI, HF and all-cause mortality. Meta-regression analyses indicated that heterogeneity could be explained by patient and study characteristics related to the presence or absence of CHD, gender and study design being retrospective or prospective. For the endpoint MI, heterogeneity was first of all explained by pre-existing CHD; AF patients without pre-existent CHD demonstrated a significantly higher risk of MI when compared to non-AF patients as opposed to stable CHD patients. We judged all included studies to be of satisfactory methodological quality. A retrospective design was a major limitation and differences in data quality might explain the tendency towards a higher risk of all endpoints related to a prospective design, as seen in Table 3 . This review is based on a comprehensive literature search designed to avoid a large heterogeneity related to comorbidities and acute stage scenarios of CHD manifestations and interventions, and the meta-analysis is based on comprehensively study-level adjusted estimates. However, the probability of unmeasured confounding cannot be excluded in observational studies. In a very recent meta-analysis of cohort studies, Odutayo et al. 30 reported an increased risk for a range of different outcomes when exposed to AF, with a high level of heterogeneity. In contrast to our study, not only stable individuals with or without CHD were included, but also a variety of study populations, such as post-acute MI and post-cardiac surgery. The present meta-analysis differs substantially, as we have narrowed the spectra of patient inclusions and performed a literature search which includes text words and subject headings. Odutayo et al. did not provide detailed information on OACs given to patients with versus without CHD, but sensitivity analysis revealed lower all-cause mortality in studies with a higher proportion of participants receiving OACs. In a recent meta-analysis of 12 studies, Guo et al. 31 reported the same increased risk of MI in AF patients as in the present study. The risk of HF and death was not studied. Interestingly, and in line with the present study, AF was associated with a significantly increased risk of MI in patients free from CHD at baseline. Stroke prevention is a major public health priority 32 and it is of interest that a greater proportion of CHD patients were treated with an OAC than CHD-free patients, which might be explanatory for their reduced risk of MI as seen in both the study of Guo et al. and in the present analysis. Supporting the trend towards a higher female risk of MI among AF patients in our study. Emdin et al. 33 reported an association with a higher risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events in women. This systematic review/meta-analysis demonstrates a relationship between AF and an increased risk of CEs and mortality, but causal evidence cannot be established. In a recent study, the presence of AF has been shown to be independently associated with a heightened risk of MI despite a lower baseline burden and progression rate of coronary atheroma. 34 Similar cardiovascular risk factors of AF and MI may reflect a common pathway of underlying disease and act as confounders such that AF may not be regarded as a causal risk factor for MI, HF and death, but a surrogate of more severe disease. In view of this, Wijesurendra et al. 35 performed magnetic resonance imaging before and after catheter ablation for AF, and stated that AF may be the consequence (rather than the cause) of an occult cardiomyopathy which persists despite a significant reduction in AF burden after ablation.\n",

      "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of arrhythmia reported in clinical practice. As this condition is associated with an increased risk of major complications, such as thrombosis and stroke, finding optimal therapies for AF has long been a topic of interest among clinicians. Although the Cox Maze III procedure has been considered the gold standard for the surgical treatment of AF since 1991, it has not been used extensively due to its complexity and invasive character. Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), the standard catheter ablation procedure for paroxysmal AF (PrAF), has success rates exceeding 70% and acceptable complication rates . However, neither epicardial ablation nor endocardial ablation alone can achieve a satisfactory result in patients with long-standing persistent AF (LSPsAF), making these patients prone to multiple repeat procedures and complications related to excessive atrial ablation. In recent years, surgeons have combined minimally invasive thoracoscopic surgery and percutaneous catheter ablation, creating a new procedure known as hybrid ablation, in an attempt to improve success rates and curb complication rates. A few systematic reviews have summarized the existing literature, focusing on aspects such as strategies for patient selection, periprocedural anticoagulation regimens, and ablation techniques . However, the efficacy and safety of the hybrid ablation procedure have not been sufficiently studied. Factors that can influence the success rates and the incidence of perioperative complications are yet to be determined. To this end, we performed a pooled analysis and meta-analysis of data from existing studies and trials.Our systematic literature search was performed according to MOOSE , Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)( S1 File ), and Cochrane guidelines. We ran searches using EMBASE (1947–Oct. 2017) ( S2 File ), MEDLINE (1950–Oct. 2017) ( S3 File ), and the Cochrane library. Two authors (first and second author) independently reviewed all articles. The primary endpoint was defined as no episode of AF or atrial tachycardia longer than 30 seconds without administration of antiarrhythmic drugs. We selected only prospective studies in which all subjects in the treatment group underwent both epicardial and endocardial ablation, either simultaneously or separately. Additionally, the follow-up methods and results, including the number of patients who were arrhythmia-free at the end of the follow-up period, had to be clearly described. Studies were excluded if they did not distinctly report the follow-up outcomes or if they reported that epicardial ablation was performed by sternotomy. When several studies covered overlapping data, we chose the study including the greatest number of patients. The corresponding author made the final decision when the fist and the second author disagreed regarding the inclusion of an article or extracted data. The data were registered into a Microsoft Excel Office 2011 spread sheet. Quality and bias of single-arm trials were assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) , a nine-point scale originally designed to assess risk of bias in cohort studies. Questions concerning control groups were excluded from the scale. Cohort studies were assessed using the original NOS scale. The first three questions assessed selection of the study population and representativeness of the study groups (age of patients, types and duration of AF). The following two questions evaluated how the studies determined exposure and assessed evidence that no similar procedures were previously performed. The remaining three points were awarded for outcome quality (Holter monitoring lasting at least 7 days as proof of sinus rhythm; SR), duration of follow-up (at least 12 months), and bias due to dropout or incomplete follow-up. A score of 5 or lower indicated a low-quality cohort study, while a score of 3 or lower was a marker of poor quality for single-arm trials. Data from all included studies were extracted into Stata (Version 14.0. College Station, TX, USA) and pooled using a random-effects model ( S4 File ). A 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran’s Q test (χ2) and I 2 method. In the Q test, a P value of <0.1 was deemed statistically significant. The I 2 method was used to assess the degree of heterogeneity, with a score discrimination of 0%–40%, 30%–60%, 50%–90%, and 75%–100% indicating low, moderate, substantial, and considerable heterogeneity, respectively . Funnel plots were constructed to explore publication bias. Incomplete or uneven plots indicated a high risk of publication bias.Our systematic literature search was performed according to MOOSE , Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)( S1 File ), and Cochrane guidelines.

Funnel plots were constructed to explore publication bias. Incomplete or uneven plots indicated a high risk of publication bias.A total of 649 studies were identified ( Fig 1 ): 364 from MEDLINE, 237 from EMBASE, and 48 from Cochrane Library. Subsequently, 243 duplicate records were excluded. After reviewing titles and abstracts, we excluded 366 other studies according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Case reports, letters, animal experiments, and reviews were removed. Of the remaining records, 12 other studies with irrelevant or ambiguous endpoints were excluded, as were 12 studies with data previously reported in other articles. Sixteen studies were included after the final review, comprising three cohort studies and 13 single-arm trials. A total of 785 patients from 16 studies were included (PrAF, n = 83; PsAF, n = 214; and LSPsAF, n = 488). Average history of AF was (5.0±1.6) years. The mean follow-up period was (21±11) months. Background information and baseline characteristics from all studies are summarized in Table 1 . The three cohort studies did not have significant differences in any of the main baseline characteristics between groups (P>0.05). Methods and follow-up regimens used in the included studies are summarized in Table 2 . At the end of the follow-up periods, 119 patients were “lost to follow-up”. Of the remaining 666 cases, 551 (82.7%) were in SR. The most commonly used follow-up methods in the 16 included studies were 7-day Holter monitoring and implantable cardiac monitors. However, two studies used mostly 24-hour Holter monitoring, while two others employed 24-hour Holter monitoring or 7-day continuous event monitoring with auto-trigger recorders at different follow-up visits. The pooled proportion of patients who underwent hybrid ablation and were arrhythmia-free at the end of follow-up without antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) (the primary endpoint reported in 15 studies) was 73% (95% CI, 64%–81%), with a substantial risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P<0.001; I 2 = 81%) ( Fig 2a ). Only 10 of the 15 studies distinctly reported the proportion of arrhythmia-free patients with administration of AADs but no repeat ablations. The pooled proportion of these patients was 81% (95% CI, 69%–91%), with a considerable risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P<0.001; I 2 = 88%). The rest of the studies failed to specify the number of repeat ablation procedures that their participants underwent. Among the studies (n = 15) reporting the success rate with AADs, repeat catheter ablation (52/666), or both, the pooled success rate was 83% (95% CI, 75%–89%), with a substantial risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P<0.001; I 2 = 78%) ( Fig 2b ). (a) Forest plot of the overall pooled proportion of arrhythmia-free patients without antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) in all studies. (b) Forest plot of the overall pooled proportion of arrhythmia-free patients with AADs or repeat ablation procedures in all studies. The clinical heterogeneity across the studies prompted us to perform a subgroup analysis of patients with LSPsAF. These data were available in seven studies (n = 168). The pooled success rate was 70% (95% CI, 51%–86%) at the primary endpoint (no arrhythmia without AADs), with a considerable risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P<0.001; I 2 = 90%). The rates and types of severe short-term complications were reported in detail in15 of the 16 studies. Severe short-term complications were defined as death during the perioperative period, conversion to sternotomy, atrial-esophageal fistula, permanent phrenic nerve injury, pericardial tamponade, pericardial effusion requiring drainage, myocardial infarction, stroke, hemothorax, and other major bleeding events. The pooled proportion of patients who developed severe short-term complications was 4% (95%, CI 2%–7%), with a moderate risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P = 0.01; I 2 = 51%) ( Fig 3 ). All 16 studies reported the energy sources used for surgical ablation. Epicardial ablation was performed using unipolar radiofrequency (RF) energy in eight studies (n = 411). Bipolar RF was used in seven studies (n = 324). One study adopted a unipolar/bipolar ablation device and was excluded from this subgroup analysis . The pooled success rate after epicardial unipolar RF ablation was 67% (95% CI, 53%–79%), with a substantial risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P<0.001; I 2 = 84%) ( Fig 4a ). After bipolar RF ablation, the success rate was 84% (95% CI, 76%–91%), with a moderate risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P = 0.04; I 2 = 55%) ( Fig 4b ). a. Forest plot of studies that used unipolar radiofrequency (RF) energy; b. Forest plot of studies that used bipolar RF energy. Six of the 16 studies adopted a staged surgical approach, but only five of these reported the proportion of patients in SR at the primary endpoint (n = 181). The time interval between the two procedures ranged from 3–4 days to 3 months . Eight trials reported using a one-step procedure (n = 411). Gersak et al and Zembala et al used both one-step and staged approaches. In a related article, Zembala et al attributed the choice of intervention to reimbursement issues. At the primary endpoint, the pooled success rate after a one-step procedure was 69% (95% CI, 53%–83%), with a considerable risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P<0.001; I 2 = 88%) ( Fig 5a ). The success rate after a staged procedure was 78% (95% CI, 67%–88%), with a substantial risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P = 0.02; I 2 = 65%) ( Fig 5b ). a.

Forest plot of one-step hybrid ablation: rate of short-term complications; d. Forest plot of staged hybrid ablation: rate of short-term complications. The pooled complication rate after a one-step procedure was 5% (95% CI, 2%–8%), with a moderate risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P = 0.09; I 2 = 43%) ( Fig 5c ). The complication rate after a staged procedure was 2% (95% CI, 0%–10%), with a substantial risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P = 0.01; I 2 = 71%) ( Fig 5d ). The two studies (n = 193) that used both staged and one-step procedures but did not report complications separately were excluded from this subgroup analysis. Three studies that did not report whether the patients underwent previous catheter ablation procedures were excluded from the subgroup analysis. Across the five studies (n = 231) that included only patients who had not experienced previous CA, the pooled success rate without AADs was 87% (95% CI, 73%–96%), with a substantial risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P<0.001; I 2 = 83%) ( Fig 6a ). Across the eight studies (n = 409) that included patients who had experienced previous CA (for AF, atrial flutter, or supraventricular tachycardia, reported in 30%-100% of the patients), the pooled success rate without AADs was 74% (95% CI, 62%–84%), with a substantial risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P<0.001; I 2 = 79%) ( Fig 6b ). a. Forest plot of patients with no previous percutaneous catheter ablation (PCA): percentage of arrhythmia-free patients; b. Forest plot of patients with previous PCA: percentage of arrhythmia-free patients. Removing the LAA could be associated with a higher incidence of perioperative complications, particularly hemorrhaging complications. None of the included studies utilized LAA occlusion devices. Across the seven studies (n = 322) that reported excision, ligation, or clip occlusion of the LAA during epicardial ablation (reported in 43%-100% of the patients), the pooled complication rate was 5% (95% CI, 1%–9%), with a moderate risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P = 0.10; I 2 = 46%). Across the nine studies (n = 463) in which the LAA remained untouched, the pooled complication rate was 4% (95% CI, 1%–8%), with a moderate risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P = 0.01; I 2 = 59%). Two studies were excluded from the sensitivity analysis for compelling reasons. Kumar et al used an essentially different methodology compared to the other studies. Only some of the pulmonary veins were isolated by epicardial ablation in this study, while cryoablation was used in the rest of the pulmonary veins. The trial conducted by Edgerton et al scored three points on the NOS and was excluded from the sensitivity analysis due to low study quality. After excluding those two studies (n = 31), the pooled success rate without AADs across the studies was 76% (95% CI, 68%–83%, Cochran’s Q, P<0.001; I 2 = 75%), while the pooled success rate with AADs or repeat CAs was 85% (95% CI, 80%–90%, Cochran’s Q, P<0.001; I 2 = 59%). Funnel plots showed a moderate risk of publication bias, as the studies were equally distributed on both sides of the central axis ( S1 Fig ). The recalculated incidence of severe complications was 4% (95% CI, 2%–7%, Cochran’s Q, P = 0.04; I 2 = 46%).A total of 649 studies were identified ( Fig 1 ): 364 from MEDLINE, 237 from EMBASE, and 48 from Cochrane Library.

Across the five studies (n = 231) that included only patients who had not experienced previous CA, the pooled success rate without AADs was 87% (95% CI, 73%–96%), with a substantial risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P<0.001; I 2 = 83%) ( Fig 6a ). Across the eight studies (n = 409) that included patients who had experienced previous CA (for AF, atrial flutter, or supraventricular tachycardia, reported in 30%-100% of the patients), the pooled success rate without AADs was 74% (95% CI, 62%–84%), with a substantial risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P<0.001; I 2 = 79%) ( Fig 6b ). a.

Forest plot of patients with previous PCA: percentage of arrhythmia-free patients. Removing the LAA could be associated with a higher incidence of perioperative complications, particularly hemorrhaging complications. None of the included studies utilized LAA occlusion devices. Across the seven studies (n = 322) that reported excision, ligation, or clip occlusion of the LAA during epicardial ablation (reported in 43%-100% of the patients), the pooled complication rate was 5% (95% CI, 1%–9%), with a moderate risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P = 0.10; I 2 = 46%). Across the nine studies (n = 463) in which the LAA remained untouched, the pooled complication rate was 4% (95% CI, 1%–8%), with a moderate risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P = 0.01; I 2 = 59%).All 16 studies reported the energy sources used for surgical ablation. Epicardial ablation was performed using unipolar radiofrequency (RF) energy in eight studies (n = 411). Bipolar RF was used in seven studies (n = 324). One study adopted a unipolar/bipolar ablation device and was excluded from this subgroup analysis . The pooled success rate after epicardial unipolar RF ablation was 67% (95% CI, 53%–79%), with a substantial risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P<0.001; I 2 = 84%) ( Fig 4a ). After bipolar RF ablation, the success rate was 84% (95% CI, 76%–91%), with a moderate risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P = 0.04; I 2 = 55%) ( Fig 4b ). a. Forest plot of studies that used unipolar radiofrequency (RF) energy; b. Forest plot of studies that used bipolar RF energy.Six of the 16 studies adopted a staged surgical approach, but only five of these reported the proportion of patients in SR at the primary endpoint (n = 181). The time interval between the two procedures ranged from 3–4 days to 3 months . Eight trials reported using a one-step procedure (n = 411). Gersak et al and Zembala et al used both one-step and staged approaches. In a related article, Zembala et al attributed the choice of intervention to reimbursement issues. At the primary endpoint, the pooled success rate after a one-step procedure was 69% (95% CI, 53%–83%), with a considerable risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P<0.001; I 2 = 88%) ( Fig 5a ). The success rate after a staged procedure was 78% (95% CI, 67%–88%), with a substantial risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P = 0.02; I 2 = 65%) ( Fig 5b ). a.

The pooled complication rate after a one-step procedure was 5% (95% CI, 2%–8%), with a moderate risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P = 0.09; I 2 = 43%) ( Fig 5c ). The complication rate after a staged procedure was 2% (95% CI, 0%–10%), with a substantial risk of heterogeneity (Cochran’s Q, P = 0.01; I 2 = 71%) ( Fig 5d ).

Kumar et al used an essentially different methodology compared to the other studies. Only some of the pulmonary veins were isolated by epicardial ablation in this study, while cryoablation was used in the rest of the pulmonary veins. The trial conducted by Edgerton et al scored three points on the NOS and was excluded from the sensitivity analysis due to low study quality. After excluding those two studies (n = 31), the pooled success rate without AADs across the studies was 76% (95% CI, 68%–83%, Cochran’s Q, P<0.001; I 2 = 75%), while the pooled success rate with AADs or repeat CAs was 85% (95% CI, 80%–90%, Cochran’s Q, P<0.001; I 2 = 59%). Funnel plots showed a moderate risk of publication bias, as the studies were equally distributed on both sides of the central axis ( S1 Fig ). The recalculated incidence of severe complications was 4% (95% CI, 2%–7%, Cochran’s Q, P = 0.04; I 2 = 46%).Hybrid ablation has emerged as a potentially effective treatment option for patients who suffer from LSPsAF. Although several traditional reviews and a few systematic reviews have discussed hybrid ablation, to date, this is the first meta-analysis focusing on the safety and efficacy of this novel procedure. We conducted a review of the relevant literature, which consisted mostly of observational studies, as anticipated. We analyzed the success rates and complication rates in the 16 studies we ultimately selected for inclusion. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were also conducted. In the 16 included studies, 82.7% (551/666) of patients were in sinus rhythm at the end of the follow-up period. The pooled proportion of patients in SR without administration of AADs was 73%. This was higher than the success rate (66%) previously reported in a systematic review that simply obtained an average of the SR rates in multiple studies. The pooled success rate with AADs or repeat catheter ablation(s) was 83%, which was also higher than the 78% rate reported in the aforementioned systematic review . This difference could be attributed to the superiority of meta-analyses in summarizing scientific results. Certain differences in article selection could also explain the discrepancy between the success rates. Trials conducted in different periods of time by the same researcher were included in our study, but excluded from the review article by Vroomen et al . Meanwhile, we excluded some articles with a high risk of overlap between study populations. Few studies have directly compared the success rates of hybrid ablation to those of other therapies. Mahapatra et al matched 15 consecutive patients who underwent hybrid ablation to 30 patients who underwent a repeat CA. After a follow-up of (20.7 ± 4.5) months, 13/15 (86.7%) patients were free from AF and off AADs after hybrid ablation, while the proportion of patients without arrhythmia and off AADs after repeat CA was only 16/30 (53.3%). This study demonstrated higher success rates after hybrid ablation compared with a repeat CA, suggesting that hybrid ablation could represent a last-resort therapy for patients with LSPsAF or other indicators of an unfavorable prognosis, such as previously failed CA. Lesion transmurality is crucial for achieving complete and durable PVI. A variety of energy sources, including RF, microwave, laser, high frequency ultrasound, and cryothermy, have been used for the ablation of AF . Experimental animal models have shown that surgical ablation using bipolar RF clamps is the most reliable method of creating circumferential transmural lesions in the pulmonary veins. Clinical trials have confirmed this result. In a review article, the success rate ranged from 85.7% to 92% in studies employing bipolar RF energy and from 36.8% to 88.9% in those utilizing unipolar RF energy . Our meta-analysis reached similar conclusions. The pooled proportion of patients in SR was 84% after bipolar ablation and 67% after unipolar RF ablation. Patients who had undergone previous CA had a lower treatment success rate (74%) than those who had not (87%). This discrepancy could be explained by the fact that previously failed ablation is suggestive of challenging cases with a stronger tendency for PV reconnection after ablation and an atrial substrate that promotes AF maintenance. The mechanisms of AF recurrence might be different in these patients . Patient safety has always been a top priority for cardiac surgeons and electrophysiologists. The hybrid ablation procedure was designed to decrease the high rate of complications associated with the traditional cut-and-sew method, while ensuring a relatively high success rate. The overall rate of short-term severe complications in our meta-analysis was 4%. This was lower than the rate previously reported by Boersma et al (9.8%) and Pokushalov et al (25%) in epicardial only (mini-maze) ablation procedures, but comparable to the 3.6% rate reported by Wang et al . As complications associated with hybrid ablation are reportedly mostly surgery-related, it is safe to conclude that the rate of severe complications associated with this procedure is no higher than the complication rate of stand-alone thoracoscopic surgical ablation. Although several authors reported no complications associated with the hybrid procedure in small to medium-sized population samples , avoiding certain life-threatening complications remains a challenge for clinicians. Atrial-esophageal fistula is a rare but life-threatening condition, which can be difficult to diagnose and can lead to death despite active treatment. Both Kiser et al (two cases) and Gehi et al (one case) reported the occurrence of atrial-esophageal fistulas and death after the use of the transdiaphragmatic surgical approach. Unipolar RF was the energy source for epicardial ablation in both of these studies. This complication could be attributed to the fact that bipolar RF clamps direct the ablation energy exclusively toward the pulmonary veins, while unipolar devices inevitably expose the esophagus to heat radiation during the ablation. Currently, RF ablation can be performed by either a thoracoscopic or a transdiaphragmatic approach. Given the nature of epicardial ablation, the possibility of perioperative cardiac tamponade is low, since the pericardium is open during the surgical procedure . Only one case of cardiac tamponade was reported (on day 24 after surgery) across the 11 studies that adopted the thoracoscopic approach in epicardial ablation. The five studies (n = 356) that adopted the transdiaphragmatic approach reported five cases of cardiac tamponade. The incidence of this complication across the five studies was 1.4% (5/356), suggesting that the transdiaphragmatic approach could carry a higher risk of cardiac tamponade. Further investigation is needed to identify the underlying causes. Excision or ligation of the LAA during the procedure did not seem to influence the perioperative complication rate (4% with ligation vs. 5% with untouched LAA), although these steps can theoretically increase the odds of short-term hemorrhagic complications. Routine excision of the LAA during hybrid ablation procedures appears to be relatively safe. As surgical centers continue to adopt hybrid ablation as a treatment option for persistent AF, safety remains the primary focus of clinicians. It is unreasonable to expose patients to a high risk of surgical complications, especially since hybrid ablation was designed to avoid the risks associated with open heart surgery. Further research is necessary to identify the best means of avoiding severe complications. By definition, the hybrid procedure combines thoracoscopic epicardial ablation with a catheter ablation procedure. However, whether a two-step procedure is superior to a one-step approach is yet to be determined. The subgroup analysis showed that the pooled success rate at the primary endpoint was lower after one-step procedures (69%) than after staged procedures (78%). The blanking period following PVI, during which the epicardial lesions mature and stabilize, may have contributed to this difference in outcomes. Reimbursement issues also played a role in the choice of procedure, as in some cases surgical decisions were shaped by reimbursement policies rather than medical considerations . Safety outcomes favor the staged approach (2%), although the complication rates are relatively low with both approaches (2% vs. 5%). Administration of anticoagulants (heparin) during CA can theoretically lead to higher incidence of hemorrhagic complications. Prolonged procedural time is a risk factor for complications as well. Although it can be partly attributed to the learning curve of surgical teams, the 2%-5% complication rate is still far from satisfactory. Further refinement of surgical techniques is necessary. The current data suggest that staged hybrid ablation could be the optimal approach, due to its higher success rate and a seemingly lower complication rate. As hybrid ablation is still an emerging therapy, guidelines for its administration are yet to be established. There are no well-established standards for determining an endpoint for hybrid ablation. Few analyses have compared success rates between patients who achieved SR spontaneously during ablation and patients who had cardioversions after the procedure. De Asmundis et al reported that conversion to SR during ablation did not improve clinical outcomes after an average follow-up time of 19 months ( P = 0.47). To date, there is no evidence that achieving SR during ablation is associated with a better prognosis following hybrid ablation.Hybrid ablation has emerged as a potentially effective treatment option for patients who suffer from LSPsAF.

Thus, there is no reliable comparison between the hybrid procedure and other therapies that are performed routinely. Furthermore, there were some differences in ablation sites and surgical techniques across studies discussing the hybrid procedure. We have also noticed a few differences in methodology between studies. We excluded those with extreme deviations from the sensitivity analysis to guard against bias.\n",

      "Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia of the heart with a prevalence of approximately 2% in the western world . Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are both associated with an increased risk of morbidity and death . The risks of both cerebral stroke and heart failure are increased nearly fivefold in patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and about 20% of every stroke may be due to atrial fibrillation . Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter also have a significant impact on healthcare costs and account for approximately 1% of the National Health Service budget in the United Kingdom and approximately 26 billion dollars of annual expenses in the United States . Two different overall intervention strategies may be used for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter–a rhythm control strategy and a rate control strategy . When using any rhythm control strategy, the aim is to obtain and maintain sinus rhythm, while the overall aim when using any rate control strategy is to lower the ventricular frequency . No former systematic review assessing the effects of rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies for atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter has searched all relevant databases and has considered both risks of systematic errors and risks of random errors .We conducted this systematic review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines (PRISMA) ( S1 Text ) , and the updated Cochrane methodology used in this systematic review is described in detail in our protocol ( S2 Text ), which was registered prior to the systematic literature search . We searched for trials comparing any rhythm control strategy with any rate control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. We searched for eligible trials published before November 2016 in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded on Web of Science, BIOSIS, Google Scholar, clinicaltrials.gov, Trip Medical Database (TRIP), EU Clinical Trial Register (EU-CTR), Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR), and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) . The search strategy can be found in the supplementary material ( S3 Text ). Additionally, we checked the reference lists of relevant publications for any unidentified trials. Trials were included irrespective of trial design, setting, publication status, publication year, language, and the reporting of one of our outcomes. Three authors (NJS, JF, EEN) independently selected relevant trials, and four authors (NJS, SS, JF, EEN) extracted data using a standardized data extraction sheet and assessed the risk of bias according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and Lundh et al. . Any discrepancies were discussed with a fifth review author (JCJ). We attempted to contact trial authors if relevant data were unclear or missing. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events (as defined by the ICH guidelines) , and quality of life. Our secondary outcomes were stroke and ejection fraction. All outcomes were analyzed as proportions of participants in each intervention group except for quality of life and ejection fraction which were both analyzed as continuous outcomes. For all outcomes, we used the trial results reported at maximal follow-up. However, if the trialists reported results at multiple time-points, we used the results reported at the time-point closest to 24 months. We planned the following subgroup analyses on our primary outcomes: comparison of different types of rhythm control interventions; comparison of different types of rate control interventions; comparison of different mean ages of participants; comparison of different durations of atrial fibrillation; comparison of different durations of anticoagulation therapy; comparison of participants with atrial fibrillation to participants with atrial flutter; and comparison of trials only randomizing men to trials only randomizing women. Additionally, we performed a post-hoc subgroup analysis: comparison of participants with heart failure to participants without heart failure. We performed our meta-analyses according to the recommendations stated in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions , Keus et al. , and the eight-step assessment suggested by Jakobsen et al. for better validation of meta-analytic results in systematic reviews. Review Manager 5 and Stata 15 were used for all meta-analyses . We used risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. We did not use standardized mean difference (SMD) when analyzing continuous outcomes due to the fact that the outcomes assessed were not homogeneous and the several methodological limitations of using this approach . We performed both random-effects (DerSimonian-Laird model) and fixed-effect meta-analysis with the Mantel-Haenszel method and chose the most conservative result as our primary result . The more conservative result was the result with the highest P value and the widest 95% confidence interval (CI). If there was substantial discrepancy between the results of the two methods, we reported and discussed the results . We used Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) to control for random errors and reported TSA-adjusted CI if the cumulative Z-curves did not reach the futility area or passed the diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) . TSA estimates the DARIS (that is the number of participants needed in a meta-analysis to detect or reject a certain intervention effect). When analyzing dichotomous outcomes, we pragmatically anticipated an intervention effect of 15% risk ratio reduction (RRR). When analyzing continuous outcomes, we pragmatically anticipated an intervention effect equal to the MD of the observed SD/2 . Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by visual inspection of forest plots and by calculating inconsistency (I 2 ) for traditional meta-analyses and diversity (D 2 ) for TSA . We calculated the 95% CI of the inconsistency (I 2 ) with the TSA software . Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the reasons for substantial statistical heterogeneity . We assessed the risk of publication bias in meta-analyses consisting of 10 trials or more with tests for funnel plot asymmetry. We assessed three primary outcomes and, hence, considered a P value of 0.025 or less as the threshold for statistical significance for the primary outcomes . We assessed two secondary outcomes and, hence, considered a P value of 0.033 as the threshold for statistical significance for the secondary outcomes . We used ‘best-worst case’ analyses and ‘worst-best case’ analyses to assess the potential impact of missing data (incomplete outcome data bias) . We calculated Bayes factor to show if the meta-analysis results fitted better with the null hypotheses or the anticipated intervention effects . We used GRADE to assess the quality of the body of evidence .We searched for trials comparing any rhythm control strategy with any rate control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. We searched for eligible trials published before November 2016 in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded on Web of Science, BIOSIS, Google Scholar, clinicaltrials.gov, Trip Medical Database (TRIP), EU Clinical Trial Register (EU-CTR), Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR), and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) . The search strategy can be found in the supplementary material ( S3 Text ). Additionally, we checked the reference lists of relevant publications for any unidentified trials. Trials were included irrespective of trial design, setting, publication status, publication year, language, and the reporting of one of our outcomes.Three authors (NJS, JF, EEN) independently selected relevant trials, and four authors (NJS, SS, JF, EEN) extracted data using a standardized data extraction sheet and assessed the risk of bias according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and Lundh et al. . Any discrepancies were discussed with a fifth review author (JCJ). We attempted to contact trial authors if relevant data were unclear or missing. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events (as defined by the ICH guidelines) , and quality of life. Our secondary outcomes were stroke and ejection fraction. All outcomes were analyzed as proportions of participants in each intervention group except for quality of life and ejection fraction which were both analyzed as continuous outcomes. For all outcomes, we used the trial results reported at maximal follow-up. However, if the trialists reported results at multiple time-points, we used the results reported at the time-point closest to 24 months. We planned the following subgroup analyses on our primary outcomes: comparison of different types of rhythm control interventions; comparison of different types of rate control interventions; comparison of different mean ages of participants; comparison of different durations of atrial fibrillation; comparison of different durations of anticoagulation therapy; comparison of participants with atrial fibrillation to participants with atrial flutter; and comparison of trials only randomizing men to trials only randomizing women. Additionally, we performed a post-hoc subgroup analysis: comparison of participants with heart failure to participants without heart failure.Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events (as defined by the ICH guidelines) , and quality of life.

Additionally, we performed a post-hoc subgroup analysis: comparison of participants with heart failure to participants without heart failure.We performed our meta-analyses according to the recommendations stated in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions , Keus et al. , and the eight-step assessment suggested by Jakobsen et al. for better validation of meta-analytic results in systematic reviews. Review Manager 5 and Stata 15 were used for all meta-analyses . We used risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. We did not use standardized mean difference (SMD) when analyzing continuous outcomes due to the fact that the outcomes assessed were not homogeneous and the several methodological limitations of using this approach . We performed both random-effects (DerSimonian-Laird model) and fixed-effect meta-analysis with the Mantel-Haenszel method and chose the most conservative result as our primary result . The more conservative result was the result with the highest P value and the widest 95% confidence interval (CI). If there was substantial discrepancy between the results of the two methods, we reported and discussed the results . We used Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) to control for random errors and reported TSA-adjusted CI if the cumulative Z-curves did not reach the futility area or passed the diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) .

We used GRADE to assess the quality of the body of evidence .Our literature search identified a total of 16 952 papers. We included 25 randomized clinical trials with 26 trial comparisons including a total of 9354 participants ( Fig 1 ) . All trials were at high risk of bias ( S1 Table ). All trials included participants with atrial fibrillation and three trials included both participants with atrial fibrillation and flutter . The individual trials used various types of rhythm control interventions and rate control interventions. The rhythm control interventions used were: amiodarone with or without electrical cardioversion (6/26 trial comparisons); not specified (6/26 trial comparisons); electrical cardioversion with antiarrhythmic drug therapy following sinus rhythm restoration (5/26 trial comparisons); catheter ablation (4/26 trial comparisons); antiarrhythmic therapy with or without electrical cardioversion (2/26 trial comparisons); ibutilide (1/26 trial comparisons); propafenone (1/26 trial comparisons); and total endoscopic ablation (1/26 trial comparisons). The rate control interventions used were: beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, or a combination of these (11/26 trial comparisons); not specified (5/26 trial comparisons); AV-node ablation (4/26 trial comparisons); digoxin and/or beta blockers (2/26 trial comparisons); diltiazem (2/26 trial comparisons); beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, and/or AV-node ablation (1/26 trial comparisons); and digoxin, carvedilol, and/or bisoprolol (1/26 trial comparisons). We have summarized the inclusion- and exclusion criteria for each included trial in S2 Table and other trial characteristics in S3 Table . Additionally, we have summarized the characteristics of excluded studies and characteristics of ongoing trials in S3 Table . We screened 16 952 records and included 56 publications of 25 trials in this systematic review. 18 trials randomizing a total of 8668 participants reported all-cause mortality. Meta-analysis showed no significant difference between rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.16; P = .35; I 2 = 0% (95% CI 0 to 33%); Bayes factor = 3438; Fig 2 ). Visual inspection of the forest plot showed no signs of heterogeneity ( Fig 2 ). The TSA showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject a RRR of 15% (TSA-adjusted CI 0.90 to 1.22) ( Fig 3 ). Incomplete outcome data bias alone had the potential to influence the results in the ‘worst-best case’-scenario ( S1 and S2 Figs). Visual inspection of the funnel plot showed no clear signs of asymmetry ( S3 Fig ). Meta-analysis showed no significant difference between rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies when assessing all-cause mortality. Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject a risk ratio reduction of 15% (TSA-adjusted confidence interval 0.90 to 1.22). The Z-curve (the blue line) does not cross any boundaries. 21 trials randomizing a total of 8789 participants reported the proportion of participants with a serious adverse event. Meta-analysis showed that rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies significantly increased the risk of a serious adverse event (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.18; P = 0.02; I 2 = 12% (95% CI 0 to 32%); Bayes factor = 1.05 e9 ; Fig 4 ). Visual inspection of the forest plot did not show signs of heterogeneity ( Fig 4 ). The TSA showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject a RRR of 15% (TSA-adjusted CI 0.99 to 1.22) ( Fig 5 ). Incomplete outcome data bias alone had the potential to influence the results in the ‘best-worst case’-scenario ( S4 and S5 Figs). Visual inspection of the funnel plot showed a bit asymmetry ( S6 Fig ), but Harbord’s test showed no significance (P = 0.63). Meta-analysis showed that rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies significantly increased the risk of a serious adverse event. Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) of serious adverse events showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject a RRR of 15% (TSA-adjusted confidence interval 0.99 to 1.22). The Z-curve (the blue line) does not cross any boundaries. We have summarized the specific types of serious adverse events in each trial in S4 Table . We did not include hospitalization for non-acute electrical cardioversion or hospitalization for elective antiarrhythmic drug loading as a serious adverse event, as readmission for non-acute electrical cardioversion and readmission for elective antiarrhythmic drug loading in most trials was mandated by the individual trial protocols (see ‘ Discussion ‘). The four primary components of the composite outcome serious adverse event (excluding all-cause mortality and stroke) were myocardial infarction, heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, and hospitalization (excluding hospitalization for non-acute electrical cardioversion and hospitalization for elective antiarrhythmic drug loading). Meta-analysis of either myocardial infarction, heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, or hospitalization (excluding hospitalization for non-acute electrical cardioversion and hospitalization for elective antiarrhythmic drug loading) showed no significant difference between rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies ( S7 – S10 Figs). All the planned tests for subgroup differences when analyzing both all-cause mortality ( S11 – S15 Figs) and serious adverse events ( S16 – S20 Figs) showed no significant differences. Two of the planned subgroup analyses (comparison of participants with atrial fibrillation to those with atrial flutter; and comparison of trials only randomizing men to trials only randomizing women) were not possible to conduct due to lack of relevant data. The post hoc subgroup analysis (comparison of participants with heart failure to participants without heart failure) also showed no significant differences when analyzing all-cause mortality ( S21 Fig ) and serious adverse events ( S22 Fig ). Quality of life was only assessed in 13 out of 24 trials and different assessment scales were used, including SF-36, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, Psychological General Well-Being Index, and Mental Health Inventory. All trials reported standard deviations for their analyses. Hence, we did not need to impute standard deviations. Only data from SF-36 physical component score, SF-36 mental component score, and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire could be used in meta-analyses. The only meta-analysis showing a statistically significant result was the analysis of the results of SF-36 physical component score (MD, 6.93 points in favor of the rhythm control group; 95% CI, 2.25 to 11.61; P = 0.004; I 2 = 95% (95% CI 94 to 96%); Bayes factor = 0.022; Fig 6 ). However, both visual inspection of the forest plot ( Fig 6 ) and the statistical tests showed considerable heterogeneity (I 2 = 95% (95% CI 94 to 96%)), and the TSA showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject a MD of 4.81 points (TSA-adjusted CI -3.16 to 17.02) ( Fig 7 ). Furthermore, incomplete outcome data bias alone had the potential to influence the results ( S23 and S24 Figs). The remaining meta-analyses (analysis of SF-36 mental component score and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire) showed no significant differences ( S25 and S26 Figs), and the TSAs showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject our anticipated intervention effects ( S27 Fig ). We have summarized all these results in Table 1 . Meta-analysis showed that rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies significantly increased the quality of life measured by SF-36 PCS. Trial Sequential Analysis showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject a mean difference of 4.81 points (TSA-adjusted confidence interval -3.16 to 17.02). The Z-curve (the blue line) does not cross any boundaries. 13 trials randomizing a total of 8114 participants reported the proportion of participants with stroke. Meta-analysis showed no significant difference between rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.38; P = .78; I 2 = 9% (95% CI 0 to 44%); Fig 8 ). Visual inspection of the forest plot did not show signs of heterogeneity ( Fig 8 ). The TSA showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject a RRR of 15% (TSA-adjusted CI 0.33 to 3.28) ( Fig 9 ). Incomplete outcome data bias alone did not have the potential to influence the results ( S28 and S29 Figs). Meta-analysis showed no significant difference between rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies when assessing stroke. Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject a risk ratio reduction of 15% (TSA-adjusted confidence interval 0.33 to 3.28). The Z-curve (the blue line) does not cross any boundaries. Seven trials randomizing a total of 428 participants assessed the effects of rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies on ejection fraction. Meta-analysis showed that rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies significantly increased the mean ejection fraction (MD, 4.20%; 95% CI, 0.54 to 7.87; P = 0.02; I 2 = 79% (95% CI 69 to 85%); Fig 10 ). Visual inspection of the forest plot showed some signs of heterogeneity ( Fig 10 ). The TSA showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject a MD of 4.20% (TSA-adjusted CI -2.37 to 10.77) ( Fig 11 ). Incomplete outcome data bias alone had the potential to influence the results in the ‘worst-best case’ scenario ( S30 and S31 Figs). Meta-analysis showed that rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies significantly increased the ejection fraction. Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject a mean difference of 4.20% (TSA-adjusted confidence interval -2.37 to 10.77).

We have summarized our main results in the Summary of Findings table ( Table 2 ).We included 25 trials randomizing a total of 9354 participants with 26 comparisons of rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies. All trials and outcome results were at high risk of bias and the quality of the evidence according to GRADE was ‘very low’ (see Summary of Findings table ( Table 2 )). The meta-analysis of serious adverse events showed that rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies significantly increased the risk of serious adverse events by approximately 10%, but TSA did not confirm this result. The increased risk of a serious adverse event did not seem to be driven by a particular component of the composite outcome. The meta-analyses of quality of life (SF-36 physical component score) and ejection fraction both showed a statistically significant effect in favor of the rhythm control group. However, TSAs showed that we did not have enough information to confirm or reject our anticipated intervention effects and the clinical relevance of an increase of 6.93 points on SF-36 physical component score and an increase of 4.20% in ejection fraction is questionable. No significant differences between rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies were found when assessing all-cause mortality, quality of life assessed by SF-36 mental component score, quality of life assessed by Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, or stroke–and all corresponding TSAs showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject our anticipated intervention effects. Our review has several strengths. We included more participants than any previous review which gives us increased power and precision to detect any significant difference between our compared treatment strategies . We followed our protocol which was registered prior to the systematic literature search . Data were double-extracted by independent authors minimizing the risk of inaccurate data-extraction, and we assessed the risk of bias in all trials according to Cochrane . We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence , TSA to assess the risks of random errors , the eight-step assessment suggested by Jakobsen et al. to assess if the thresholds for significance were crossed , and sensitivity analyses (best-worst and worst-best) to test the potential impact of incomplete outcome data bias. Hence, this systematic review considered both risks of random errors and risks of systematic errors which adds further robustness to our results and conclusions. Another strength of our review is that we pragmatically accepted any rhythm control strategy and any rate control strategy–our results may therefore guide a clinician when choosing between the treatment strategies. The main result of this review is the apparent increased risk of a serious adverse event when using rhythm control strategies and the statistical heterogeneity of this meta-analysis result was low (I 2 = 12% (95% CI 0 to 32%)). Hence, the included trials seem to show very similar results which increase the validity of the meta-analysis result. As mentioned in the results section, we did not plan to include hospitalization for non-acute electrical cardioversion or hospitalization for elective antiarrhythmic drug loading as a serious adverse event, but it might be argued that any hospitalization ought to be considered a serious adverse event . If we had included hospitalization for non-acute electrical cardioversion and hospitalization for elective antiarrhythmic drug loading, which in multiple trials were mandated by their protocol, the increased risk of a serious adverse event in the rhythm control group would be even greater. A post hoc meta-analysis confirmed this assumption ( S32 Fig ). Our results after excluding hospitalization for non-acute electrical cardioversion and hospitalization for elective antiarrhythmic drug loading as a serious adverse event were still significant which also increase the validity of our results. Our review also has several limitations. All trials were at high risk of bias and especially the risk of incomplete blinding of participants and personnel and for-profit bias might bias our review results. Our assessment of especially publication bias was also uncertain, as a relatively low number of trials were included. Furthermore, some of the performed meta-analyses had considerable statistical heterogeneity. Hence, publication bias and heterogeneity might further bias our results. Large meta-epidemiological studies have shown that high risks of bias tend to overestimate benefits and underestimate harms of experimental interventions . We hypothesized that the rhythm control strategy in most trials may be regarded as the experimental group and that the risk of a serious adverse event when using rhythm control strategies might be even higher than our results show due to the risk of bias. When assessing the overall quality of the available evidence, GRADE assessment showed that the quality of the evidence was ‘very low’ for all outcomes, mostly due to risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency (see Summary of Findings table ( Table 2 )). Another limitation of our present review is the use of a composite outcome such as serious adverse events. A potential limitation when using composite outcomes is that each component of a composite outcome (in this case serious adverse events) will not necessarily have similar degrees of severity and will not be affected similarly by the interventions . ‘True’ differences in severity between compared groups might therefore not be reflected in review results when using composite outcomes . Several of the included trials did not specify the type of serious adverse events but it was, e.g., often just reported that a given patient was hospitalized ( S4 Table ). Hence, it was difficult to assess severity differences between the compared groups when assessing risks of serious adverse events. We believe that the clinical relevance of the outcome ‘serious adverse events’ and the resulting increased statistical power when using serious adverse events as an outcome justifies the use of serious adverse events as a primary outcome, but the interpretative limitations ought to be considered. A further limitation of our review is that we considered rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies as two goal oriented intervention strategies. Due to widely varying interventions within the two groups, we were not able to assess the effects of each single intervention. However, even though the specific treatment elements of both rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies differed across trials ( S3 Table ), our results on both all-cause mortality and serious adverse events showed very limited statistical heterogeneity and test for subgroup differences showed no significant differences. Furthermore, our results show an averaged effect and if certain specific treatment elements have beneficial effects that differ from our overall meta-analysis results then other treatment elements must have more harmful effects. Nevertheless, it might be that certain single treatment elements have effects that are not shown by our analyses. The results on quality of life and ejection fraction had very large degrees of statistical heterogeneity and were especially at high risk of selective outcome reporting bias. Accordingly, these results should be interpreted with great caution. The higher risk of a serious adverse event in the rhythm control group might be caused by incorrect use of anticoagulation therapy in the rhythm control group, i.e., physicians might avoid prescribing appropriate anticoagulation therapy if the patient has obtained sinus rhythm. We performed several subgroup analyses comparing trials with different recommendations for anticoagulation therapy (anticoagulation therapy until sinus rhythm for at least 4 weeks compared to anticoagulation therapy until sinus rhythm for at least 12 weeks compared to anticoagulation therapy until end of follow-up) ( S20 Fig ). No subgroup differences were found. Additionally, we found no difference between rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies when assessing stroke and the point estimate was very close to 1.00 (1.04) ( Fig 8 ). If the participants in the rhythm control group had received insufficient anticoagulation therapy, we would have expected a higher risk of stroke in the rhythm control group. We have identified multiple systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter . The most recent review, made by Al-Khatib et al., was published in 2014 . They included 16 trials randomizing 7608 participants and showed comparable efficacy of rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies . The other previous reviews showed similar findings , except Testa et al. who showed that rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies significantly increased the risk of the combined outcome of all-cause mortality and stroke by OR at 1.15 . However, their meta-analysis only included five trials randomizing 5239 participants . We did not plan to assess this composite outcome but a post hoc meta-analysis assessing this composite outcome did not show any significant difference between rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies ( S33 Fig ). Our present review is the first systematic review of randomized clinical trials showing that rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies significantly increases the risk of a serious adverse event. Furthermore, no clinically significant beneficial effect of rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies was found. We have also identified multiple observational studies assessing the effects of rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter , but these studies showed conflicting results. Comparable to our findings, Noheria et al. included 6988 participants and showed comparable efficacy of rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies when assessing all-cause mortality, heart failure, and stroke, but rhythm control strategies significantly increased the risk of cardiovascular hospitalizations . Contrary to our findings, Ionescu-Ittu et al. included 26 130 participants and showed comparable efficacy of the strategies when assessing all-cause mortality within four years of treatment onset, but five and eight years after treatment onset rate control strategies significantly increased the risk of dying . Furthermore, Camm et al. included 5604 participants and showed that rhythm control strategies were superior to rate control strategies . A fourth study, Purmah et al., showed comparable efficacy of the strategies when assessing all-cause mortality . The different results between these observational studies might be caused by, e.g., different inclusion- and exclusion criteria, baseline confounding factors, and confounding by unmeasured variables . Accordingly, observational studies may or may not support our findings. Current guidelines and recent narrative reviews recommend that a rate control strategy should be used in most patients, while a rhythm control strategy is indicated only to improve symptoms in patients who remain symptomatic on adequate rate control therapy . Our results confirm this recommendation and further indicate that rhythm control strategies seem to be more harmful than rate control strategies without any meaningful beneficial effect of rhythm control strategies. Nevertheless, January et al. reports that a rhythm control strategy might be favored in specific patient subgroups. We performed several relevant subgroup analyses and found no significant differences. Moreover, no randomized clinical trial has investigated the effect of rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies in young patients, and the other subgroup analyses had limited data. Hence, we were not able to investigate if specific patient subgroups differed compared to our main results. We identified eight ongoing trials (see S3 Table ) that might contribute to the current evidence on rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies for atrial fibrillation . These ongoing trials will contribute to the evidence on all-cause mortality, hospitalization, stroke, quality of life, and ejection fraction. Furthermore, AFARC-LVF (NCT02509754), EAST-AFNET 4 , and RAFT-AF will focus on the effect of catheter ablation as a rhythm control strategy. These three trials will provide evidence on whether or not catheter ablation is superior to rate control. All ongoing and future trials should be conducted with low risk of systematic error and low risk of random errors, and ought to be designed and reported according to the SPIRIT and CONSORT guidelines .The meta-analysis of serious adverse events showed that rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies significantly increased the risk of serious adverse events by approximately 10%, but TSA did not confirm this result. The increased risk of a serious adverse event did not seem to be driven by a particular component of the composite outcome. The meta-analyses of quality of life (SF-36 physical component score) and ejection fraction both showed a statistically significant effect in favor of the rhythm control group. However, TSAs showed that we did not have enough information to confirm or reject our anticipated intervention effects and the clinical relevance of an increase of 6.93 points on SF-36 physical component score and an increase of 4.20% in ejection fraction is questionable. No significant differences between rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies were found when assessing all-cause mortality, quality of life assessed by SF-36 mental component score, quality of life assessed by Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, or stroke–and all corresponding TSAs showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject our anticipated intervention effects.Our review has several strengths. We included more participants than any previous review which gives us increased power and precision to detect any significant difference between our compared treatment strategies . We followed our protocol which was registered prior to the systematic literature search . Data were double-extracted by independent authors minimizing the risk of inaccurate data-extraction, and we assessed the risk of bias in all trials according to Cochrane . We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence , TSA to assess the risks of random errors , the eight-step assessment suggested by Jakobsen et al. to assess if the thresholds for significance were crossed , and sensitivity analyses (best-worst and worst-best) to test the potential impact of incomplete outcome data bias. Hence, this systematic review considered both risks of random errors and risks of systematic errors which adds further robustness to our results and conclusions. Another strength of our review is that we pragmatically accepted any rhythm control strategy and any rate control strategy–our results may therefore guide a clinician when choosing between the treatment strategies. The main result of this review is the apparent increased risk of a serious adverse event when using rhythm control strategies and the statistical heterogeneity of this meta-analysis result was low (I 2 = 12% (95% CI 0 to 32%)). Hence, the included trials seem to show very similar results which increase the validity of the meta-analysis result. As mentioned in the results section, we did not plan to include hospitalization for non-acute electrical cardioversion or hospitalization for elective antiarrhythmic drug loading as a serious adverse event, but it might be argued that any hospitalization ought to be considered a serious adverse event . If we had included hospitalization for non-acute electrical cardioversion and hospitalization for elective antiarrhythmic drug loading, which in multiple trials were mandated by their protocol, the increased risk of a serious adverse event in the rhythm control group would be even greater. A post hoc meta-analysis confirmed this assumption ( S32 Fig ). Our results after excluding hospitalization for non-acute electrical cardioversion and hospitalization for elective antiarrhythmic drug loading as a serious adverse event were still significant which also increase the validity of our results. Our review also has several limitations. All trials were at high risk of bias and especially the risk of incomplete blinding of participants and personnel and for-profit bias might bias our review results. Our assessment of especially publication bias was also uncertain, as a relatively low number of trials were included. Furthermore, some of the performed meta-analyses had considerable statistical heterogeneity. Hence, publication bias and heterogeneity might further bias our results. Large meta-epidemiological studies have shown that high risks of bias tend to overestimate benefits and underestimate harms of experimental interventions . We hypothesized that the rhythm control strategy in most trials may be regarded as the experimental group and that the risk of a serious adverse event when using rhythm control strategies might be even higher than our results show due to the risk of bias. When assessing the overall quality of the available evidence, GRADE assessment showed that the quality of the evidence was ‘very low’ for all outcomes, mostly due to risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency (see Summary of Findings table ( Table 2 )). Another limitation of our present review is the use of a composite outcome such as serious adverse events. A potential limitation when using composite outcomes is that each component of a composite outcome (in this case serious adverse events) will not necessarily have similar degrees of severity and will not be affected similarly by the interventions . ‘True’ differences in severity between compared groups might therefore not be reflected in review results when using composite outcomes . Several of the included trials did not specify the type of serious adverse events but it was, e.g., often just reported that a given patient was hospitalized ( S4 Table ). Hence, it was difficult to assess severity differences between the compared groups when assessing risks of serious adverse events. We believe that the clinical relevance of the outcome ‘serious adverse events’ and the resulting increased statistical power when using serious adverse events as an outcome justifies the use of serious adverse events as a primary outcome, but the interpretative limitations ought to be considered. A further limitation of our review is that we considered rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies as two goal oriented intervention strategies. Due to widely varying interventions within the two groups, we were not able to assess the effects of each single intervention. However, even though the specific treatment elements of both rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies differed across trials ( S3 Table ), our results on both all-cause mortality and serious adverse events showed very limited statistical heterogeneity and test for subgroup differences showed no significant differences. Furthermore, our results show an averaged effect and if certain specific treatment elements have beneficial effects that differ from our overall meta-analysis results then other treatment elements must have more harmful effects. Nevertheless, it might be that certain single treatment elements have effects that are not shown by our analyses. The results on quality of life and ejection fraction had very large degrees of statistical heterogeneity and were especially at high risk of selective outcome reporting bias. Accordingly, these results should be interpreted with great caution. The higher risk of a serious adverse event in the rhythm control group might be caused by incorrect use of anticoagulation therapy in the rhythm control group, i.e., physicians might avoid prescribing appropriate anticoagulation therapy if the patient has obtained sinus rhythm. We performed several subgroup analyses comparing trials with different recommendations for anticoagulation therapy (anticoagulation therapy until sinus rhythm for at least 4 weeks compared to anticoagulation therapy until sinus rhythm for at least 12 weeks compared to anticoagulation therapy until end of follow-up) ( S20 Fig ). No subgroup differences were found. Additionally, we found no difference between rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies when assessing stroke and the point estimate was very close to 1.00 (1.04) ( Fig 8 ). If the participants in the rhythm control group had received insufficient anticoagulation therapy, we would have expected a higher risk of stroke in the rhythm control group.We have identified multiple systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter .

      "Hyperthyroidism, or thyrotoxicosis occurs due to excess release of thyroid hormone due to an overactive thyroid gland or passive release of the stored hormone. Additionally, hyperthyroidism occurs from over treatment with thyroid hormone. Hyperthyroidism is generally considered overt or subclinical, depending on the biochemical severity of the hyperthyroidism. Overt hyperthyroidism is defined as suppressed (usually undetectable) thyrotropin (TSH) and elevated levels of triiodothyronine (T3) and/or estimated free thyroxine (free T4). Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a low or undetectable serum TSH with values within the normal reference range for both T3 and free T4. 1 Hyperthyroidism should be considered the potential illness whenever TSH level is subnormal. The prevalence of hyperthyroidism in the United States is approximately 1.2% (0.5% overt and 0.7% subclinical). 2 In an older community in Baltimore, the prevalence of low TSH was 9.6% for participants on thyroid hormone and 0.8% for untreated individuals. 3 In a study performed by Krahn et al., the authors found that <1% of cases of atrial fibrillation are secondary to an acute hyperthyroid state. 4 Despite hyperthyroidism being a relatively rare cause of atrial fibrillation, this review underscores the importance of identifying thyrotoxic atrial fibrillation, understanding differences in pathophysiology and management as well as illustrating the importance of screening for hyperthyroidism in those presenting with atrial fibrillation. We have compiled literature from PubMed, Scopus and Ovid to ensure a thorough and accurate literature review.Hyperthyroidism is a well-known cause of atrial fibrillation. In a large population based study by frost and colleagues, all patients with new onset hyperthyroidism in the inpatient setting were followed ±30 days from the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism to observe for a new onset diagnosis of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. It was found that 8.3% of such patients had a new onset diagnosis of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. 2 In patients with hyperthyroidism it was found that those who were male, advancing age, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and valvular heart disease were found to have a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation. 5 In a large nationwide cohort study performed in Denmark by Selmer and colleagues, patients who were diagnosed with new onset atrial fibrillation were followed in the outpatient setting for 13 years to identify if they would develop hyperthyroidism. 6 In the 13 year follow up there was a significantly higher incidence of hyperthyroidism being diagnosed particularly in the male population between the ages of 51–60 when compared to the general population of that age without a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. Another Canadian study was performed testing this association on a smaller scale and failed to show an association. 7 However, as the study performed by Selmer and colleagues was the most comprehensive study, its clinical application includes routine screening for hyperthyroidism in patients with new onset atrial fibrillation. While there are no studies on the incidence of subclinical hyperthyroidism after presenting with atrial fibrillation, routine monitoring of thyroid studies would identify this subgroup. The authors believed that these findings may have been secondary to: 1 Autoantibody formation against β1-adrenergic and M2-muscarinic receptors has been known to occur in hyperthyroidism and may trigger Atrial fibrillation prior to thyroid dysfunction. 8 2 A genetic susceptibility to atrial fibrillation may be linked to hyperthyroidism 9 3 Patients may have relative rises or falls in thyroid function testing, yet still remain within normal limits compared to reference values. Such variation may increase the risk of developing atrial fibrillation and will subsequently increase the risk of clinical hyperthyroidism in the future 10 , 11 Autoantibody formation against β1-adrenergic and M2-muscarinic receptors has been known to occur in hyperthyroidism and may trigger Atrial fibrillation prior to thyroid dysfunction. 8 A genetic susceptibility to atrial fibrillation may be linked to hyperthyroidism 9 Patients may have relative rises or falls in thyroid function testing, yet still remain within normal limits compared to reference values. Such variation may increase the risk of developing atrial fibrillation and will subsequently increase the risk of clinical hyperthyroidism in the future 10 , 11 Current guidelines are not available regarding frequency of screening and are per clinician discretion.In a large nationwide cohort study performed in Denmark by Selmer and colleagues, patients who were diagnosed with new onset atrial fibrillation were followed in the outpatient setting for 13 years to identify if they would develop hyperthyroidism. 6 In the 13 year follow up there was a significantly higher incidence of hyperthyroidism being diagnosed particularly in the male population between the ages of 51–60 when compared to the general population of that age without a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.

If the patient has a long wavelength as per this theory then re-entry will not be maintained and thus self terminate. 13 In order for atrial fibrillation to be sustained the wavelength has to be short enough such that wavefronts can circulate the atrium without termination. As per this theory, atrial refractoriness, conduction velocity or both has to be sufficiently reduced to allow re-entry of wavefronts and sustainment of atrial fibrillatory waves. Other theories exist regarding the mechanism of atrial fibrillation including the presence of anatomical substrate and abnormal ectopic atrial firing. Because anyone of these abnormal findings can result in atrial fibrillation, it is important to note differences in pathophysiology between those who have atrial fibrillation with hyperthyroid and euthyroid functions. In those patients who were hyperthyroid it was found that elevated thyroid hormone altered the β1-adrenergic and M2-muscarinic receptors of the heart resulting in increased sympathetic function, tachycardia and decreased atrial refractory period. It is also known that thyroid hormone plays a role in altering ionic channels. In a study performed by Watanbe et al. the effects of thyroid hormone on mRNA expression and currents of major ionic channels were studied in murine atria. The authors found that thyroid hormone resulted in such major changes 14 : 1.) Decreased L-type Calcium channel mRNA expression 2.) Increased expression of Kv 1.5 mRNA 3.) The above changes resulted in increased outward current and decreased inward current resulting in shorter action potential duration Decreased L-type Calcium channel mRNA expression Increased expression of Kv 1.5 mRNA The above changes resulted in increased outward current and decreased inward current resulting in shorter action potential duration In another study performed in rats, the authors compared action potential duration and whole cell currents in the right and left atria in both euthyroid and hyperthyroid mice. The authors found more significant shortening of APD and greater delayed rectifier potassium current increases in the right atrium than the left atrium in hyperthyroid rats which can further increase the risk for atrial arrhythmias. 15 A separate study performed by Chen et al. studied the effects of thyroid hormone on the arrhythmogenic activity of pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes in rabbits. The authors found that thyroid hormone had the following effects on arrhythmogenesis 16 : 1.) Decreased APD 2.) Increased spontaneous activity in pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes 3.) Increased occurrence of delayed after-depolarizations in pulmonary vein beating and non-beating cardiomyocytes 4.) Increased after-depolarizations in beating cardiomyocytes Decreased APD Increased spontaneous activity in pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes Increased occurrence of delayed after-depolarizations in pulmonary vein beating and non-beating cardiomyocytes Increased after-depolarizations in beating cardiomyocytes With the following changes noted, the authors concluded that thyroid hormone plays a role on arrhythmogenesis with an increase of triggered activity or automaticity in pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes. 16 Atrial fibrillation in hyperthyroid human patients, similar to the animal models as discussed is believed to be due to a decreased atrial refractory period and increased sympathetic tone with decreased heart-rate variability. 17 Wustmann and colleagues noted that hyperthyroid patients with no known diagnosis of atrial fibrillation when compared to euthyroid patients without a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation were found to have an increased incidence of supraventricular depolarizations which normalized after treating the hyperthyroidism. 18 While these supraventricular depolarizations have been linked to developing atrial fibrillation in patients who are euthyroid, Wustmann and colleagues did not attempt to prove any causal relationship in hyperthyroid patients. Another study performed by Komiya and colleagues showed that when invasive electrophysiological tests were performed on hyperthyroid patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, in comparison to the control group, there was no increased incidence of abnormal atrial electrograms, whereas those with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who were euthyroid had a significantly increased incidence of abnormal atrial electrograms when compared to the control. Komiya and colleagues also noted that in patients who were euthyroid, atrial refractory period was not reduced in comparison to controls. 19 Interestingly, the only common finding noted between euthyroid and hyperthyroid patients in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation was a prolonged conduction delay and conduction zone. A flowchart illustrating the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation in hyperthyroidism is shown in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 A figure illustrating the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation in hyperthyroidism. A figure illustrating the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation in hyperthyroidism. Sawin and his group reported a 2.8-fold increased risk of atrial fibrillation in subclinical hyperthyroid individuals over the age of 60. 20 Subsequent studies reported similar results. 21 , 22 The Rotterdam study performed by Heeringa and colleagues, showed a graded response in patients with atrial fibrillation and thyroxine levels and lower TSH. 11 The mechanism involved was hypothesized by Heeringa and colleagues and is believed to be threefold: 1 Active T 3 binds to T3 Nuclear receptors resulting in specific cardiac gene expression 2 T3 Reduces heart rate variability by reducing vagal tone increasing risk for arrhythmias 3 T3 causes peripheral vasodilation increasing cardiac preload and altering contraction Active T 3 binds to T3 Nuclear receptors resulting in specific cardiac gene expression T3 Reduces heart rate variability by reducing vagal tone increasing risk for arrhythmias T3 causes peripheral vasodilation increasing cardiac preload and altering contraction TSH has also been identified as an independent predictor of developing atrial fibrillation with lower limits of normal increasing risk regardless of free T4 levels in patients greater than age 60 within the next decade. 20 While no guidelines are available regarding the frequency of monitoring thyroid function, the association noted prompts close monitoring of thyroid function status in the elderly per clinician discretion. Cardioversion may be an option in those who remain in atrial fibrillation after 8–10 weeks of remaining in a euthyroid state with anticoagulation for at least three weeks due to the concern of atrial stunning. In patients with atrial fibrillation who are of euthyroid or hyperthyroid status at the time of diagnosis, it is important to note that the chances of failed cardioversion dramatically increase with time. A large risk for recurrence is noted 1 year after diagnosis and even larger risk of recurrence 2 years after diagnosis. 23 In a study performed by Gurdogan and colleagues, irrespective of thyroid status, prolonged duration of atrial fibrillation prior to cardioversion was a poor predictor for sustaining sinus rhythm. 24 Further studies are required to identify those who are good candidates for cardioversion when there is a history of hyperthyroidism. In patients with hyperthyroidism related atrial fibrillation, there is no clear consensus in the present literature regarding the efficacy of catheter ablation. Ma et al. studied the efficacy of circumferential pulmonary vein ablation in patients with thyrotoxic atrial fibrillation and found that it was a viable therapeutic option. 25 A case-control study evaluating the efficacy of catheter ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with a history of AIT found that a single ablation with pulmonary vein isolation had a lower efficacy when compared to patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation without a history of AIT. A history of AIT was also found to be an independent predictor of atrial tachycardia. After multiple ablations however, the risk of recurrence was noted to be equal in patients with and without AIT. 26 A subsequent study performed by Wang et al. studying the safety and efficacy of early radiofrequency catheter ablation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation complicated with AIT found that pulmonary vein isolation was safe and efficacious with a higher incidence of atrial tachyarrhythmias occurring up to three months post procedure but were not noted 12 months post procedure when matched with controls. 27 In a separate study performed by Machino et al., the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation with pulmonary vein isolation was tested in patients who had a history of hyperthyroidism and were euthyroid for a period of three months and matched with a control group of patients with atrial fibrillation without a history of hyperthyroidism. The authors found that there was no difference in risk of occurrence of atrial fibrillation in both groups. 28 Another study performed by Wongcharoen et al. showed that patients with a history of hyperthyroidism had more frequent ectopic events and a higher risk of occurrence of atrial fibrillation after a single ablation. 29 In this study however, the risk of recurrence was not tested after multiple ablations. In the majority of studies, ablation was considered after restoring a euthyroid state for at least three months and was indicated for refractory atrial fibrillation. Thus we conclude that in those patients who have permenant, refractory atrial fibrillation despite restoration of a euthyroid state, ablation may be considered. However, owing to the higher risk of recurrence, multiple ablations are usually required. Atrial Fibrillation has been known to significantly increase the risk of developing stroke and thrombotic episodes. The current guidelines use the CHA2DS2-VASC scoring system to predict who is at increased risk for a thrombotic episode and would benefit from anticoagulation. Atrial Fibrillation with hyperthyroidism has been studied in various trials with varying results. As per an analysis performed by Presti and Hart regarding several older trials, hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation have been shown to independently increase the risk of a thrombotic episode regardless of CHA2DS2-VASC score, particularly embolic events to the central nervous system early in the course of the disease. 30 In a large recent trial conducted in China by Chan et al., of 9727 Chinese patients with nonvalvular AF from July 1997 to December 2011, hyperthyroidism with atrial fibrillation was not known to independently increase the risk of thrombotic events with the risk for thrombosis based of the traditional risk factors outlined in the CHA2DS2-VASC score. 31 Two major recommendations are present regarding anticoagulation in those with atrial fibrillation and hyperthyroidism. As per the American College of Chest Physicians, hyperthyroidism was not found to be an independent risk factor of thrombosis in those with atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation should be based of the traditional CHA2DS2-VASC score. 31 , 32 According to the American College of Cardiology however, hyperthyroidism independently increases the risk for development of stroke or thrombosis and patients should receive anticoagulation during the hyperthyroid phase regardless of CHA2DS2-VASC score. 33 In a study performed by de Souza and colleagues, in patients with hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation, a traditional CHADS2 score was used to predict who would benefit from anticoagulation with a subsequent TEE performed to assess the efficacy of the score in identifying possible thrombogenic milieu. In this study it was found that only age was an accurate predictor of thrombogenic milieu with the remaining risk factors having a low yield. 34 This study further delineates that the decision to initiate anticoagulation in patients who have hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation may ideally be done on an individual basis. In the majority of cases, the cause of hyperthyroidism is either secondary to autoimmune (graves) disease, toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma. The mainstay of treatment is B-blockade and treatment with an anti-thyroid agent (PTU or methimazole). While B-blocker therapy is first line to manage narrow complex tachyarrhythmias in the setting of thyrotoxicosis, in certain cases of tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy there may be a concern for hemodynamic compromise. In such cases a short acting B-blocker such as esmolol may be given to assess tolerability. 23 Digoxin may also be considered in those with a tenuous hemodynamic status. However, due to a few factors; increased renal clearance, increased sympathetic tone in atrial fibrillation with reduced vagal tone and a large volume of distribution of digoxin, a larger than usual dose of digoxin is required, thus caution must be used to avoid digoxin toxicity. 35 , 36 In patient’s where B-blocker therapy is contraindicated, other management choices include calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem or verapamil. These agents should however be avoided in those with a reduced ejection fraction or hemodynamic instability due to a strong negative inotropic effect. Amiodarone may be used in the acute setting due to the benefit of converting the patient to normal sinus rhythm when combined with anti-thyroid medications such as PTU to reduce the chance of worsening thyrotoxicosis. 37 Caution must be used however due to the risk of atrial stunning and thrombogenic phenomenon if not properly anticoagulated. Regarding anticoagulation, at present, there is no consensus on the recommendation for anticoagulation during thyroid storm. Elevated thyroxine levels in thyroid storm are known to theoretically increase the risk of a thrombotic event secondary to a metabolic change that occurs in these patients namely: increased levels of Factor VIII, Factor IX, fibrinogen, vWF, plasminogen activator-inhibitor-1 and deficiency of antithrombin III with increased clearance of circulating heparin. 38 , 39 The choice to anticoagulate patients in thyroid storm is per the clinician’s decision. Some clinicians choose to anticoagulate based of CHA2DS2-VASC score whereas others anticoagulate during the thyrotoxic phase regardless of other thrombotic risk factors. Rhythm control is usually not recommended in patients with hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation as nearly two-thirds of patients revert to normal sinus rhythm 8–10 weeks after achieving a euthyroid state. 40 In those patients who continue to remain in atrial fibrillation after achieving a euthyroid state, rhythm control may be an option however like the general atrial fibrillation population, rate control is usually preferred initially. Options for rhythm control include class IA, IC as well as class III agents. The use of amiodarone may be indicated acutely as mentioned above during a thyroid storm to restore sinus rhythm or for chronic therapy in those with atrial fibrillation refractory to rate control. While the use of amiodarone has not been clearly studied in those with thyrotoxic atrial fibrillation, amiodarone is known to cause hyperthyroidism as well as hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism secondary to amiodarone is known as amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) and has been further sub classified into two categories. AIT has an incidence of approximately 3% in North America with an incidence of 10% for those living in iodine-depleted areas. 41 AIT Type I occurs in patients with underlying thyroid disease wherein the iodine load from amiodarone therapy (75 mg of iodine per 200 mg oral tablet) results in increased production of T3 and T4 known as the Jod- Basedow phenomenon. 42 AIT Type 2 is secondary to an autoimmune destructive thyroiditis where in T3 and T4 is released from the thyroid gland. This is secondary to an elevated concentration of iodide from pharmacological therapy resulting in inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis and release of stored hormone from the thyroid gland known as the Wolf-Chaikoff effect. 43 AIT type 1 has a higher incidence in countries with iodine deficient regions whereas AIT type 2 is more common in iodine replete areas. 44 In a study performed by Czarnywojtek et al., in patients who were previously hyperthyroid and underwent radioactive ablation of the thyroid gland (presently euthyroid), the efficacy of administering radioactive iodine was assessed prior to initiating amiodarone therapy despite being euthyroid at the time of administration. As per this study the authors concluded that the use of preventive radioactive iodine in euthyroid patients who were previously hyperthyroid prior to chronic amiodarone therapy was found to reduce the incidence of thyrotoxicosis and subsequently help sustain sinus rhythm. Of note 5 patients required an additional dose of radioactive iodine during this study. 45 In another study performed by Kunii et al., the efficacy of Bepridil was tested in converting patients with atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm in those with and without co-morbid hyperthyroidism. The authors found that Bepidril was equally efficacious irrespective of thyroid status. 46 However, owing to the untoward effects of Bepidril such as the risk of Torsade de pointe, the drug has been banned in several countries and should be used cautiously. In patients with overt hyperthyroidism without atrial fibrillation, thyroid treatment is warranted to reduce the risk of this potential complication. Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism should be done in individuals older than 65 and with a TSH level of <0.1 mU/L. If the patient is less than 65 year-old and TSH >0.1, treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism should be done if the individual has symptoms or has other risk factors i.e. heart disease or bisphosphonate treatment. 1 , 47 The prognosis of those with hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation has not been previously studied to our knowledge. However, identifying that hyperthyroidism is a causative factor of atrial fibrillation plays a crucial role in management as outlined above. Similarly, while the prevalence of hypothyroidism is significantly higher in those with atrial fibrillation when compared to hyperthyroidism, in a large study performed by Selmer et al. as mentioned above, routine follow up with patients after the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation showed that the incidence of hyperthyroidism was significantly higher when matched with those without a history of atrial fibrillation. 6 Thus while no current guidelines are available, routine screening with TSH levels after the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation may help with early detection of hyperthyroidism and decrease the risk of metabolic and cardiovascular side effects.Sawin and his group reported a 2.8-fold increased risk of atrial fibrillation in subclinical hyperthyroid individuals over the age of 60. 20 Subsequent studies reported similar results. 21 , 22 The Rotterdam study performed by Heeringa and colleagues, showed a graded response in patients with atrial fibrillation and thyroxine levels and lower TSH. 11 The mechanism involved was hypothesized by Heeringa and colleagues and is believed to be threefold: 1 Active T 3 binds to T3 Nuclear receptors resulting in specific cardiac gene expression 2 T3 Reduces heart rate variability by reducing vagal tone increasing risk for arrhythmias 3 T3 causes peripheral vasodilation increasing cardiac preload and altering contraction Active T 3 binds to T3 Nuclear receptors resulting in specific cardiac gene expression T3 Reduces heart rate variability by reducing vagal tone increasing risk for arrhythmias T3 causes peripheral vasodilation increasing cardiac preload and altering contraction TSH has also been identified as an independent predictor of developing atrial fibrillation with lower limits of normal increasing risk regardless of free T4 levels in patients greater than age 60 within the next decade. 20 While no guidelines are available regarding the frequency of monitoring thyroid function, the association noted prompts close monitoring of thyroid function status in the elderly per clinician discretion.Cardioversion may be an option in those who remain in atrial fibrillation after 8–10 weeks of remaining in a euthyroid state with anticoagulation for at least three weeks due to the concern of atrial stunning. In patients with atrial fibrillation who are of euthyroid or hyperthyroid status at the time of diagnosis, it is important to note that the chances of failed cardioversion dramatically increase with time. A large risk for recurrence is noted 1 year after diagnosis and even larger risk of recurrence 2 years after diagnosis. 23 In a study performed by Gurdogan and colleagues, irrespective of thyroid status, prolonged duration of atrial fibrillation prior to cardioversion was a poor predictor for sustaining sinus rhythm. 24 Further studies are required to identify those who are good candidates for cardioversion when there is a history of hyperthyroidism.In patients with hyperthyroidism related atrial fibrillation, there is no clear consensus in the present literature regarding the efficacy of catheter ablation. Ma et al. studied the efficacy of circumferential pulmonary vein ablation in patients with thyrotoxic atrial fibrillation and found that it was a viable therapeutic option. 25 A case-control study evaluating the efficacy of catheter ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with a history of AIT found that a single ablation with pulmonary vein isolation had a lower efficacy when compared to patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation without a history of AIT. A history of AIT was also found to be an independent predictor of atrial tachycardia. After multiple ablations however, the risk of recurrence was noted to be equal in patients with and without AIT. 26 A subsequent study performed by Wang et al. studying the safety and efficacy of early radiofrequency catheter ablation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation complicated with AIT found that pulmonary vein isolation was safe and efficacious with a higher incidence of atrial tachyarrhythmias occurring up to three months post procedure but were not noted 12 months post procedure when matched with controls. 27 In a separate study performed by Machino et al., the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation with pulmonary vein isolation was tested in patients who had a history of hyperthyroidism and were euthyroid for a period of three months and matched with a control group of patients with atrial fibrillation without a history of hyperthyroidism. The authors found that there was no difference in risk of occurrence of atrial fibrillation in both groups. 28 Another study performed by Wongcharoen et al. showed that patients with a history of hyperthyroidism had more frequent ectopic events and a higher risk of occurrence of atrial fibrillation after a single ablation. 29 In this study however, the risk of recurrence was not tested after multiple ablations. In the majority of studies, ablation was considered after restoring a euthyroid state for at least three months and was indicated for refractory atrial fibrillation. Thus we conclude that in those patients who have permenant, refractory atrial fibrillation despite restoration of a euthyroid state, ablation may be considered. However, owing to the higher risk of recurrence, multiple ablations are usually required.Atrial Fibrillation has been known to significantly increase the risk of developing stroke and thrombotic episodes. The current guidelines use the CHA2DS2-VASC scoring system to predict who is at increased risk for a thrombotic episode and would benefit from anticoagulation. Atrial Fibrillation with hyperthyroidism has been studied in various trials with varying results. As per an analysis performed by Presti and Hart regarding several older trials, hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation have been shown to independently increase the risk of a thrombotic episode regardless of CHA2DS2-VASC score, particularly embolic events to the central nervous system early in the course of the disease. 30 In a large recent trial conducted in China by Chan et al., of 9727 Chinese patients with nonvalvular AF from July 1997 to December 2011, hyperthyroidism with atrial fibrillation was not known to independently increase the risk of thrombotic events with the risk for thrombosis based of the traditional risk factors outlined in the CHA2DS2-VASC score. 31 Two major recommendations are present regarding anticoagulation in those with atrial fibrillation and hyperthyroidism. As per the American College of Chest Physicians, hyperthyroidism was not found to be an independent risk factor of thrombosis in those with atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation should be based of the traditional CHA2DS2-VASC score. 31 , 32 According to the American College of Cardiology however, hyperthyroidism independently increases the risk for development of stroke or thrombosis and patients should receive anticoagulation during the hyperthyroid phase regardless of CHA2DS2-VASC score. 33 In a study performed by de Souza and colleagues, in patients with hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation, a traditional CHADS2 score was used to predict who would benefit from anticoagulation with a subsequent TEE performed to assess the efficacy of the score in identifying possible thrombogenic milieu. In this study it was found that only age was an accurate predictor of thrombogenic milieu with the remaining risk factors having a low yield. 34 This study further delineates that the decision to initiate anticoagulation in patients who have hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation may ideally be done on an individual basis.In the majority of cases, the cause of hyperthyroidism is either secondary to autoimmune (graves) disease, toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma. The mainstay of treatment is B-blockade and treatment with an anti-thyroid agent (PTU or methimazole). While B-blocker therapy is first line to manage narrow complex tachyarrhythmias in the setting of thyrotoxicosis, in certain cases of tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy there may be a concern for hemodynamic compromise. In such cases a short acting B-blocker such as esmolol may be given to assess tolerability. 23 Digoxin may also be considered in those with a tenuous hemodynamic status. However, due to a few factors; increased renal clearance, increased sympathetic tone in atrial fibrillation with reduced vagal tone and a large volume of distribution of digoxin, a larger than usual dose of digoxin is required, thus caution must be used to avoid digoxin toxicity. 35 , 36 In patient’s where B-blocker therapy is contraindicated, other management choices include calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem or verapamil. These agents should however be avoided in those with a reduced ejection fraction or hemodynamic instability due to a strong negative inotropic effect. Amiodarone may be used in the acute setting due to the benefit of converting the patient to normal sinus rhythm when combined with anti-thyroid medications such as PTU to reduce the chance of worsening thyrotoxicosis. 37 Caution must be used however due to the risk of atrial stunning and thrombogenic phenomenon if not properly anticoagulated. Regarding anticoagulation, at present, there is no consensus on the recommendation for anticoagulation during thyroid storm. Elevated thyroxine levels in thyroid storm are known to theoretically increase the risk of a thrombotic event secondary to a metabolic change that occurs in these patients namely: increased levels of Factor VIII, Factor IX, fibrinogen, vWF, plasminogen activator-inhibitor-1 and deficiency of antithrombin III with increased clearance of circulating heparin. 38 , 39 The choice to anticoagulate patients in thyroid storm is per the clinician’s decision. Some clinicians choose to anticoagulate based of CHA2DS2-VASC score whereas others anticoagulate during the thyrotoxic phase regardless of other thrombotic risk factors.Rhythm control is usually not recommended in patients with hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation as nearly two-thirds of patients revert to normal sinus rhythm 8–10 weeks after achieving a euthyroid state. 40 In those patients who continue to remain in atrial fibrillation after achieving a euthyroid state, rhythm control may be an option however like the general atrial fibrillation population, rate control is usually preferred initially. Options for rhythm control include class IA, IC as well as class III agents. The use of amiodarone may be indicated acutely as mentioned above during a thyroid storm to restore sinus rhythm or for chronic therapy in those with atrial fibrillation refractory to rate control. While the use of amiodarone has not been clearly studied in those with thyrotoxic atrial fibrillation, amiodarone is known to cause hyperthyroidism as well as hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism secondary to amiodarone is known as amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) and has been further sub classified into two categories. AIT has an incidence of approximately 3% in North America with an incidence of 10% for those living in iodine-depleted areas. 41 AIT Type I occurs in patients with underlying thyroid disease wherein the iodine load from amiodarone therapy (75 mg of iodine per 200 mg oral tablet) results in increased production of T3 and T4 known as the Jod- Basedow phenomenon. 42 AIT Type 2 is secondary to an autoimmune destructive thyroiditis where in T3 and T4 is released from the thyroid gland. This is secondary to an elevated concentration of iodide from pharmacological therapy resulting in inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis and release of stored hormone from the thyroid gland known as the Wolf-Chaikoff effect. 43 AIT type 1 has a higher incidence in countries with iodine deficient regions whereas AIT type 2 is more common in iodine replete areas. 44 In a study performed by Czarnywojtek et al., in patients who were previously hyperthyroid and underwent radioactive ablation of the thyroid gland (presently euthyroid), the efficacy of administering radioactive iodine was assessed prior to initiating amiodarone therapy despite being euthyroid at the time of administration.

Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism should be done in individuals older than 65 and with a TSH level of <0.1 mU/L. If the patient is less than 65 year-old and TSH >0.1, treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism should be done if the individual has symptoms or has other risk factors i.e. heart disease or bisphosphonate treatment. 1 , 47The prognosis of those with hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation has not been previously studied to our knowledge. However, identifying that hyperthyroidism is a causative factor of atrial fibrillation plays a crucial role in management as outlined above.

      "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is predicted to double in prevalence over the next 20 years. It is not only associated with adverse prognosis, but accounts for considerable healthcare expenditure. Numerous studies have identified a substantial reduction in health-related quality of life (QoL) in AF populations. Patients with AF experience symptoms such as palpitations, exercise intolerance, dizziness and dyspnea, which frequently limit capacity to undertake daily activities. Apart from anticoagulation to prevent strokes, current management of AF is focused on reducing symptoms and improving QoL. Even well-established therapies in AF have proven to have little impact on death and other adverse outcomes, including rate and rhythm control therapy. Although the fundamental reason for pursing such therapies is to improve QoL, there is limited appreciation of how to measure QoL in clinical practice. A variety of both generic and AF-specific questionnaires are available to assess patient-reported QoL. Generic patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), such as the SF-36 and EQ-5D questionnaires, have the advantage of allowing comparison of QoL in patients with different diseases, but are less sensitive to the effects of a single disease on QoL. With the growing burden of AF, the relatively high cost of treatment, and the appreciation of QoL as a treatment objective, there has been substantial interest in the development of AF-specific PROMs for use in both clinical research and routine practice. However, these have yet to enter routine clinical practice, in part due to concerns about their validity and responsiveness. Our objective was to perform a systematic review of the measurement properties of disease-specific PROMs measuring QoL in AF, assessing studies which designed and validated the questionnaires. We aim to provide clinicians with an understanding of whether these instruments would likely be of value in research and clinical practice. We utilized a comprehensive methodology from the Consensus based Standards for selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) group , which includes rigorous assessment of validity, reliability, and responsiveness of QoL questionnaires.We included all studies that examined at least one or more measurement properties of a disease-specific PROM measuring QoL in patients with AF (aged 18 years and older). We permitted inclusion of studies with interviewer-based administration, as long as questionnaires were self-reported by patients. Studies were required to be published as a full-text article. Articles were excluded if the article failed to specify the type of tool utilized. There was no restriction on language, date of publication or type of AF. A systematic search was performed in Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL from inception until the 15 th February 2015 and in the Cochrane library from 1993 to 9 th March 2015. The search strategy (see S1 Appendix ) consisted of 3 filters composed of search terms for the following: (1) AF; (2) PROMs; and (3) measurement properties. The latter two filters were developed at the University of Oxford and VU University Medical Center respectively (available at www.cosmin.nl ). All filters were adapted for each database. Reference lists of the included studies were also manually searched in addition to articles that cited them. This review was prospectively registered with the PROSPERO database of systematic reviews ( http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.asp?ID=CRD42015016600 ). In this paper, we report on our primary outcome which addresses the quality of AF-specific PROMs using the COSMIN methodology. For each study, two investigators independently extracted and tabulated data on a standardized data extraction form. Discrepancies and missing data were resolved by group discussion, reference to the original publication and additional adjudication. Two studies published in Japanese were first translated by a Cardiologist fluent in both the Japanese and English languages. The COSMIN checklist was used by two independent reviewers to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. This tool distinguishes three main domains (reliability, validity and responsiveness), subdivided into nine measurement properties. For each measurement property, numerous standards are included in the form of questions to determine the quality of the study. Each item per measurement property is scored as excellent, fair, good or poor, with the lowest rating determining the overall quality score for that study (“worst score counts” method). Measurement properties were rated for quality against criteria for optimal measurement properties. Each result was rated as either positive (+), negative (-) or indeterminate (?), providing that methodological quality was not poor. Table 1 summarizes the definitions of the nine measurement properties assessed and the preferred methods for their assessment, based on the COSMIN taxonomy, with detailed criteria presented in S1 Table . Best evidence synthesis was performed by applying levels of evidence developed by Terwee et al . ( www.cosmin.nl ), combining the ratings of study quality with the strength of findings to determine an overall judgement for each questionnaire, as demonstrated in S2 Table .We included all studies that examined at least one or more measurement properties of a disease-specific PROM measuring QoL in patients with AF (aged 18 years and older).

( www.cosmin.nl ), combining the ratings of study quality with the strength of findings to determine an overall judgement for each questionnaire, as demonstrated in S2 Table .The results of the search strategy are outlined in Fig 1 . After removal of duplicates, the literature search yielded 2,216 articles of which eight were included in the final analysis. A summary of studies excluded at the full-text stage is presented in S3 Table . Study inclusion flowchart. See S1 Appendix for search strategy. We identified five questionnaires developed and validated for the assessment of quality of life in AF: Atrial Fibrillation 6 (AF6) , Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-Life (AFEQT) , Atrial Fibrillation Quality of Life Questionnaire (AFQLQ) , Atrial Fibrillation Quality of Life (AFQoL) , and Quality of Life in Atrial Fibrillation (QLAF). The characteristics of the questionnaires included in this review and the study populations in which their measurement properties were evaluated are summarized in Table 2 . The QoL questionnaires were assessed in a variety of geographical locations, however patients were of a similar mean age (62–67 years). Women were under-represented in all of the cohorts (20–43%). The type of AF varied in the individual studies, although on average there was an even split between paroxysmal and more persistent forms. Results of the assessment of validity for each instrument are detailed in S4 Table and for reliability and responsiveness in S5 Table . It was not possible to rate any of the instruments in relation to measurement error, as statistical evaluations were not reported. Similarly, there were no data on cross cultural validity, and hence study quality and instrument ratings were not performed for these domains. A summary of findings is presented in Fig 2 . Best evidence synthesis to provide an overall appraisal of each questionnaire is detailed in Table 3 , limited by the availability of only one or two published articles for each questionnaire. Below, we concisely review the main results for the individual QoL instruments alphabetically. For each measurement property, the PROM is assessed for methodological quality of the study (excellent, good, fair or poor) and given an overall rating (positive , negative or indeterminate/unknown ) for the results. A level of evidence was applied, combining the number and quality of the studies with the strength of findings. Studies that have poor quality are given an ‘indeterminate /unknown’ rating due to the limited level of evidence. For AFQoL, reliability was assessed differently in the two related studies. * Insufficient data were available to rate this criterion. See Table 1 for assessment criteria. AF6 was evaluated in 2 articles, both utilizing the same cohort of 111 patients recruited in Sweden. Reliability: The quality of the study was fair for internal consistency and reliability, with both of these measurement properties rated positively. Internal consistency was only evaluated in patients who underwent direct current cardioversion (which may not be representative of general AF patients and can variably affect QoL depending on success). Test-retest reliability was only assessed in 9 patients who had failed cardioversion, with 3 of the 6 items (limitations in daily life due to AF, discomfort due to AF and fatigue due to AF) associated with poor coefficient values. Validity: Content validity and hypothesis testing of this instrument were rated as indeterminate due to poor ratings for reported methodology. For criterion validity, appropriate statistics were not reported. Structural validity assessment was deemed of fair quality overall, although statistical methods and handling of missing data were excellent and the instrument was positively rated for this measurement property. Responsiveness: Only assessed in a single study of poor methodological quality, which did not describe the construct of the comparator (SF-36) or detail the handling of missing data or the underlying hypotheses. Synthesis: Two measurement properties was positively rated based on limited evidence. AFEQT was evaluated in a single article composed of 213 patients recruited from hospitals across North America. The population was predominantly of European descent and English-speaking. Reliability: The quality of the study was excellent for internal consistency and fair for test-retest reliability, due to inadequate information regarding the environment of questionnaire administration. Both measurement properties were rated as positive. Validity: The quality of the study on content validity was deemed methodologically excellent, whereas the quality of the study regarding structural validity, hypothesis testing and criterion validity were rated fair as the handling of missing data was not detailed. All of these validity aspects were rated positive. Responsiveness: Although there was excellent description of hypotheses, comparators and methods, the overall quality of the study was rated fair, as responsiveness was only assessed in cohorts of patients who received an intervention (66 patients with medication adjustment and 76 with ablation). It was unclear how missing data were handled, and the expected or achieved correlations were not reported. The responsiveness of the instrument was however, rated as positive (data presented in S5 Table ). Comparison with generic QoL measures (SF-36 and EQ-5D) resulted in smaller effect sizes, although the responsiveness of the AFEQT was comparable to the Toronto AF Symptoms Check List and Atrial Fibrillation Severity Scale. Synthesis: Two measurement properties showed strong positive evidence, and four were positive based on limited evidence. AFQLQ was studied in two articles, both recruiting patients from Japan. Reliability: Assessed in a single article, quality was categorized as methodically fair for both internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Although the sample size was >100, both measurement properties were marked down due to inadequate information on missing data and potential differences in test conditions during resampling. Both measurement properties were rated positive. Validity: Structural validity was investigated in a single article. The study was methodologically fair as assessment was only performed in a small number of patients and the handling of missing data was not clearly reported. The instrument was positively rated for structural validity. No information was available on other validity aspects. Responsiveness: Assessed in a single article , this study was rated as methodically poor. It was unclear if changes occurred in the patients during the interim period, either in treatment or symptoms, and the study failed to detail expected hypotheses. Synthesis: Three positive measurement properties with limited evidence, however there was insufficient data to rate 5 out of 9 measurement properties. AFQoL was assessed in two articles recruiting Spanish patients from hospitals across Madrid and Bilbao. Reliability: An evaluation of internal consistency was rated as methodologically fair in both articles, whereas test-retest was rated fair in one and poor in the other , due to the relatively small sample size, uncertainty if the test conditions were the same, and lack of details regarding the handling of missing data. The instrument was rated positive for internal consistency in both articles , but indeterminate for test-retest reliability. Validity: Content validity and structural validity were assessed in a single article. The quality of content validity assessment was methodologically excellent, while structural validity was deemed fair due to omission of details on the handling of missing data. The instrument was rated positively for both of these measurement properties. The study on hypothesis testing was methodologically poor due to a lack of detail on the self-perceived health status scale employed, hence the instrument was rated indeterminate. Criterion validity was assessed in a single article , with fair study quality but an indeterminate rating as QoL was compared with patients post-myocardial infarction. Responsiveness: Assessed in a single article of poor methodologically quality , as only correlations between baseline SF-36 and AFQoL were reported. Synthesis: One measurement property showed strong positive evidence, and two were positive based on limited evidence. QLAF was assessed in a single article consisting of 63 patients recruited from centers across Brazil. Reliability: The assessment of internal consistency was rated as methodically poor as factor analysis was not performed. Study quality for test-retest reliability was fair, due to the small sample size and insufficient detail on the handling of missing items. The instrument was rated as positive for this measurement property. Validity: Content validity was rated as methodologically poor, as the questionnaire was administered to a small target population and there was no patient involvement in the questionnaire design. Prior hypotheses regarding expected correlations between the SF-36 and QLAF were not stated when undertaking hypothesis testing and appropriate statistics were not used during criterion validity assessment; thus both construct and criterion validity were rated as methodologically poor. Responsiveness: Poor study quality due to a lack of appropriate statistical analysis. Synthesis: One measurement property showed positive evidence based on limited evidence.The results of the search strategy are outlined in Fig 1 .

Responsiveness: Assessed in a single article , this study was rated as methodically poor. It was unclear if changes occurred in the patients during the interim period, either in treatment or symptoms, and the study failed to detail expected hypotheses. Synthesis: Three positive measurement properties with limited evidence, however there was insufficient data to rate 5 out of 9 measurement properties. AFQoL was assessed in two articles recruiting Spanish patients from hospitals across Madrid and Bilbao. Reliability: An evaluation of internal consistency was rated as methodologically fair in both articles, whereas test-retest was rated fair in one and poor in the other , due to the relatively small sample size, uncertainty if the test conditions were the same, and lack of details regarding the handling of missing data. The instrument was rated positive for internal consistency in both articles , but indeterminate for test-retest reliability. Validity: Content validity and structural validity were assessed in a single article. The quality of content validity assessment was methodologically excellent, while structural validity was deemed fair due to omission of details on the handling of missing data. The instrument was rated positively for both of these measurement properties. The study on hypothesis testing was methodologically poor due to a lack of detail on the self-perceived health status scale employed, hence the instrument was rated indeterminate. Criterion validity was assessed in a single article , with fair study quality but an indeterminate rating as QoL was compared with patients post-myocardial infarction. Responsiveness: Assessed in a single article of poor methodologically quality , as only correlations between baseline SF-36 and AFQoL were reported. Synthesis: One measurement property showed strong positive evidence, and two were positive based on limited evidence. QLAF was assessed in a single article consisting of 63 patients recruited from centers across Brazil. Reliability: The assessment of internal consistency was rated as methodically poor as factor analysis was not performed. Study quality for test-retest reliability was fair, due to the small sample size and insufficient detail on the handling of missing items. The instrument was rated as positive for this measurement property. Validity: Content validity was rated as methodologically poor, as the questionnaire was administered to a small target population and there was no patient involvement in the questionnaire design. Prior hypotheses regarding expected correlations between the SF-36 and QLAF were not stated when undertaking hypothesis testing and appropriate statistics were not used during criterion validity assessment; thus both construct and criterion validity were rated as methodologically poor. Responsiveness: Poor study quality due to a lack of appropriate statistical analysis. Synthesis: One measurement property showed positive evidence based on limited evidence.AF6 was evaluated in 2 articles, both utilizing the same cohort of 111 patients recruited in Sweden. Reliability: The quality of the study was fair for internal consistency and reliability, with both of these measurement properties rated positively. Internal consistency was only evaluated in patients who underwent direct current cardioversion (which may not be representative of general AF patients and can variably affect QoL depending on success). Test-retest reliability was only assessed in 9 patients who had failed cardioversion, with 3 of the 6 items (limitations in daily life due to AF, discomfort due to AF and fatigue due to AF) associated with poor coefficient values. Validity: Content validity and hypothesis testing of this instrument were rated as indeterminate due to poor ratings for reported methodology. For criterion validity, appropriate statistics were not reported. Structural validity assessment was deemed of fair quality overall, although statistical methods and handling of missing data were excellent and the instrument was positively rated for this measurement property. Responsiveness: Only assessed in a single study of poor methodological quality, which did not describe the construct of the comparator (SF-36) or detail the handling of missing data or the underlying hypotheses. Synthesis: Two measurement properties was positively rated based on limited evidence.AFEQT was evaluated in a single article composed of 213 patients recruited from hospitals across North America. The population was predominantly of European descent and English-speaking. Reliability: The quality of the study was excellent for internal consistency and fair for test-retest reliability, due to inadequate information regarding the environment of questionnaire administration. Both measurement properties were rated as positive. Validity: The quality of the study on content validity was deemed methodologically excellent, whereas the quality of the study regarding structural validity, hypothesis testing and criterion validity were rated fair as the handling of missing data was not detailed. All of these validity aspects were rated positive. Responsiveness: Although there was excellent description of hypotheses, comparators and methods, the overall quality of the study was rated fair, as responsiveness was only assessed in cohorts of patients who received an intervention (66 patients with medication adjustment and 76 with ablation). It was unclear how missing data were handled, and the expected or achieved correlations were not reported. The responsiveness of the instrument was however, rated as positive (data presented in S5 Table ). Comparison with generic QoL measures (SF-36 and EQ-5D) resulted in smaller effect sizes, although the responsiveness of the AFEQT was comparable to the Toronto AF Symptoms Check List and Atrial Fibrillation Severity Scale. Synthesis: Two measurement properties showed strong positive evidence, and four were positive based on limited evidence.AFQLQ was studied in two articles, both recruiting patients from Japan. Reliability: Assessed in a single article, quality was categorized as methodically fair for both internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Although the sample size was >100, both measurement properties were marked down due to inadequate information on missing data and potential differences in test conditions during resampling. Both measurement properties were rated positive. Validity: Structural validity was investigated in a single article. The study was methodologically fair as assessment was only performed in a small number of patients and the handling of missing data was not clearly reported. The instrument was positively rated for structural validity. No information was available on other validity aspects. Responsiveness: Assessed in a single article , this study was rated as methodically poor.

Synthesis: One measurement property showed positive evidence based on limited evidence.This comprehensive systematic review identified five health-related QoL questionnaires used to assess AF populations, and evaluated their measurement properties using the COSMIN approach. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate the methodological quality of studies and the measurement properties of QoL questionnaires in AF patients. Our key finding was the lack of robust psychometric testing of any of the currently available AF-specific QoL instrument, particularly for measurement error. We found deficiencies in most instruments in relation to reliability, construct and criterion validity, but particularly in the responsiveness of questionnaires. The results raise important questions about the use of these instruments in research and daily clinical practice, and suggest the need for further evaluation before implementation. Quality of life encompasses a person's perceptions of their physical and psychological state, social relationships and environment. Many generic and disease-specific questionnaires exist to assess QoL in AF patients. The Short Form 36 (SF-36) is perhaps the most common generic QoL measure , and often used as a gold-standard comparator in the validation of other questionnaires (although as there is no ‘true’ gold-standard measure, criterion validity remains problematic to adequately appraise). Generic measures are useful to determine overall QoL in the population, particularly to quantify health utility or for comparing between diseases and populations. However, they may not be as sensitive to the effect of a single disease on QoL , whereas disease-specific questionnaires assess domains more relevant to the particular condition and may provide more targeted information to inform shared-decision making. There is increasing interest in evaluating the effect of management strategies on QoL among AF patients, but for clinical confidence, the tool used should demonstrate good responsiveness, in addition to being a reliable and valid measure. Indeed, a recently developed QoL questionnaire for patients undergoing catheter ablation for cardiac arrhythmias has demonstrated responsiveness to clinical change. This review utilized the COSMIN approach for performing the systematic review. The COSMIN taxonomy was developed after an international Delphi study , using a consensus of terminology across validation studies and allowing standardized objective assessment of measurement properties. Further, the group have developed standards (the COSMIN checklist) for how measurement properties should be evaluated and provide a structured protocol for undertaking such reviews to a high quality ( http://www.cosmin.nl/ ). The COSMIN methodology has been incorporated into several other reviews to evaluate PROM assessment across a variety of diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , osteoarthritis , cancer , multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s Disease. Whilst the standards within COSMIN are high, the thresholds for reliability are in line with the International Society for Quality of Life Research (ISOQOL) requirements. It could be argued that high standards are needed to drive improvements in the methodology of development and validation of PROMs, and allow clinicians to have greater confidence in their use. As with any system based on scientific judgment, our results based on the COSMIN approach are only one component of evaluating quality of life questionnaires. A specific limitation of our review was the inclusion of questionnaires developed and validated before the COSMIN checklist became widely available, which may have impacted on the scores assigned for methodological quality. This may be less of an issue in future reviews, where validation studies would ideally have incorporated the COSMIN checklist. There are other methodologies available for evaluating PROMs, for example the Federal Drug Administration scheme, which utilizes broadly similar assessment categories. However, the COSMIN approach offers a more quantifiable appraisal of measurement properties. Secondly, the inclusion of two Japanese papers requiring translation meant these articles were assessed by a sole reviewer, which may impact on internal validity. We are also limited to the ‘general’ AF populations studied, whereas patients with specific comorbidities may respond differently to PROMs. For example, heart failure is a common comorbidity in AF that is underrepresented in the studies evaluated. The content of these questionnaires demonstrates some similarities among them, with 4 out of 5 examining the type and/or frequency of symptoms (the only exception being AFQoL), and all except QLAF assessing the impact of AF on daily activities, physical and psychological functioning, albeit to differing extent. Synthesis of results in our review showed that AFEQT demonstrated strong positive evidence for internal consistency and content validity and AFQoL showed strong positive evidence for content validity. All other questionnaires failed to provide sufficient evidence to make a strong positive rating. Neither measurement error nor cross-cultural validity were appropriately assessed in any study and there were limited data for responsiveness, which we were only able to rate for AFEQT. Where study quality was poor, or ratings indeterminate, this does not mean that a particular questionnaire performed badly, only that the evidence was limited. For example, AFQoL, in addition to AFEQT, demonstrated strong positive evidence for content validity, an important measurement property that is the foundation of a good QoL questionnaire. Refinements to AF PROMs are ongoing, and AFQLQ was recently updated to a second version, demonstrating good intra- and inter-observer reproducibility and internal consistency in 40 AF patients. However, even with full information on psychometric properties, clinical validity requires further appraisal in large-scale AF populations, a review of which is beyond the scope of this methodological assessment. Apart from AFEQT , there is limited information about the minimally important change seen with these questionnaires. With the growing burden of AF and the equivocal benefit of rate or rhythm-control strategies in improving mortality , there is increasing importance of QoL assessment. Over 34 different QoL questionnaires have been utilized in published AF studies emphasizing the current lack of consensus on the best instrument to assess QoL. Our assessment of methodological quality suggests that reported results for the available instruments should be treated with caution and that further, more robust validation is required to determine if these measures are appropriate to assess QoL in clinical populations. However, adequate measurement properties are just one aspect of whether a QoL tool is useful in research and clinical practice. Cost, ease of administration, time taken and patient acceptability are also important considerations. Future studies are clearly required that address the detectable change in scores, as well as the responsiveness of the questionnaire to changes in patient symptoms and management strategies in the clinical setting. One such study that is due to commence shorty is the RAte Control Therapy Evaluation in Atrial Fibrillation (RATE-AF) randomized trial. \n",

The other way to approach this (the easier way) is just to compare the list of keywords for each article and calculate a similarity score; if they are quite similar, then concatenate. The most nlp way of doing this is to calculate the document vector for each abstract and see how far apart they are."
