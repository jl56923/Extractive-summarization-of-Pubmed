       "  'abstract_text': 'Pulse palpation has been recommended as the first step of screening to detect atrial fibrillation. We aimed to determine and compare the accuracy of different methods for detecting pulse irregularities caused by atrial fibrillation. We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and LILACS until 16 March 2015. Two reviewers identified eligible studies, extracted data and appraised quality using the QUADAS-2 instrument. Meta-analysis, using the bivariate hierarchical random effects method, determined average operating points for sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative likelihood ratios (PLR, NLR); we constructed summary receiver operating characteristic plots. Twenty-one studies investigated 39 interventions (n = 15,129 pulse assessments) for detecting atrial fibrillation. Compared to 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) diagnosed atrial fibrillation, blood pressure monitors (BPMs; seven interventions) and non-12-lead ECGs (20 interventions) had the greatest accuracy for detecting pulse irregularities attributable to atrial fibrillation (BPM: sensitivity 0.98 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92–1.00), specificity 0.92 (95% CI 0.88–0.95), PLR 12.1 (95% CI 8.2–17.8) and NLR 0.02 (95% CI 0.00–0.09); non-12-lead ECG: sensitivity 0.91 (95% CI 0.86–0.94), specificity 0.95 (95% CI 0.92–0.97), PLR 20.1 (95% CI 12–33.7), NLR 0.09 (95% CI 0.06–0.14)). There were similar findings for smartphone applications (six interventions) although these studies were small in size. The sensitivity and specificity of pulse palpation (six interventions) were 0.92 (95% CI 0.85–0.96) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.76–0.88), respectively (PLR 5.2 (95% CI 3.8–7.2), NLR 0.1 (95% CI 0.05–0.18)). BPMs and non-12-lead ECG were most accurate for detecting pulse irregularities caused by atrial fibrillation; other technologies may therefore be pragmatic alternatives to pulse palpation for the first step of atrial fibrillation screening.',\n",
       "  'article_text': 'Atrial fibrillation (AF) has a prevalence that increases with age. 1 , 2 AF is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, most notably from its associated four to fivefold increased risk of ischaemic stroke, 3 and poses a significant public health burden. 4 The SAFE trial was the largest randomised study of AF screening in primary care and found this to be an effective method for increasing AF detection when compared to routine practice. 5 , 6 Combined with the subsequent provision of antithrombotic therapy, 7 , 8 screening is likely to reduce thromboembolic complications from AF 9 and, consequently, this has been proposed to improve AF. 10 , 11 AF screening is a two-stage process. Firstly, asymptomatic patients with irregular pulses are identified and then AF is confirmed or excluded using 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG). 8 , 10 The accuracy with which irregular pulses are caused by AF is important; a high false positive rate would result in many patients having unnecessary ECG examinations, whereas a high false negative rate could mean excessive AF diagnoses are missed. The SAFE trial used opportunistic pulse palpation to identify patients over 65 years of age with an irregular pulse. Although this approach was found to be effective, no other methods for identifying irregular pulses have been tested in trials of AF screening. Pulse palpation may not be the optimal ‘first step’ in identifying patients with suspected AF and using modified blood pressure (BP) monitors, pulse oximetry or non-12-lead ECG devices, for example, could improve the process of screening. 12 Despite pulse palpation being a cheap method for detecting AF, this results in high false positive cases of suspected AF and it may be possible to improve the accuracy of identifying patients with suspected AF using alternative methods. This systematic review aimed to provide evidence to underpin the first stage of AF screening by describing and comparing the diagnostic accuracies of methods for identifying patients with irregular pulses caused by AF.This study was conducted in accordance with guidelines and methods for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of diagnostic tests. 13 – 16 We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL) and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Information System (LILACS) in all languages published until 16 March 2015 (Appendix 1). In addition, the reference lists of national guidelines, review articles and included studies were hand-searched to identify eligible studies. All randomised trials and observational studies, with the exclusion of case reports and case series, which recruited participants ≥18 years of age, investigated any method of identifying patients with an irregular pulse or suspected AF (the index test) and compared the index test with any ECG interpreted by a competent professional (the reference standard), involved healthcare professionals identifying patients with an irregular pulse, and reported sufficient data to enable calculation of diagnostic accuracy were included. Studies that investigated invasive or echocardiographic methods of identifying AF were excluded. After the removal of duplicate records, two reviewers (JT and MJ) independently screened citations for relevance and reviewed full-text articles using predetermined eligibility criteria. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus with a third reviewer (TC). Data were independently extracted using a prespecified data extraction form by two reviewers (JT and MJ). Any disagreements were resolved by consensus with a third reviewer (TC). When studies reported findings using multiple thresholds for the same intervention, only data in which thresholds maximised the sensitivity of the index test were extracted in order to avoid duplicate inclusion of the same index test. The lead authors of studies for which there were insufficient data for calculation of diagnostic accuracy were contacted to ascertain missing data; studies were only excluded if no additional data were identified or if the authors failed to respond. Study quality was appraised using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies-2 (QUADAS-2) instrument. 15 , 17 In addition, the studies were graded using the quality scale reported by Van den Bruel et al.; 18 studies were rated as grade A if they fulfilled all QUADAS-2 criteria. Studies were graded D if there was no or unclear verification of the index test findings with the reference standard, or if the index test results were interpreted unblinded to the results of the reference test. Studies in which there was an unduly long time delay between index and reference tests, or the reference test was not independent of the index test, or the reference test was interpreted unblinded to the results of the index test were graded C. The remaining studies that did not fall into these categories were graded B. We constructed 2 × 2 contingency tables to enable calculation of the sensitivity and specificity of each method for identifying patients with suspected AF. Meta-analysis, using the bivariate hierarchical random effects method, was used to determine the average operating points for sensitivity and specificity, and enabled the construction of summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) plots with 95% prediction regions. We also calculated positive and negative likelihood ratios (PLR and NLR) for each detection method. Unlike sensitivity and specificity, likelihood ratios make explicit the impact of the test result on the probability of disease. To minimise heterogeneity we analysed the results a priori in groups of each method for identifying an irregular pulse. Subgroup analyses were planned according to study quality and studies conducted in primary care providing there were four or more studies within subgroups. Heterogeneity is presumed in meta-analyses of diagnostic test studies and the I 2 statistic cannot be reliably used for its assessment. 16 We therefore described any variation in the outcomes from included studies and our pooled estimates by visual inspection of the SROC plots and how close individual studies lie to the predicted receiver operating characteristic curve. 16 Publication bias was assessed within categories of method for detecting AF using Deeks’ funnel plot asymmetry test; a P value less than 0.10 was used to signify the presence of publication bias.

From these, 69 were identified for detailed evaluation ( Figure 1 ). After full-text review, 21 studies were included in the final analyses (Appendix 2). 9 , 19 – 38 Five studies met the selection criteria, but reported insufficient outcome data and were excluded (Appendix 3). 39 – 43 Figure 1. Study selection and stratification. Study selection and stratification. Of the 21 studies included (Appendix 2), there were two randomised trials, 9 , 30 seven case–control, 20 , 21 , 26 , 32 – 35 two cohort 24 , 38 and 10 cross-sectional 19 , 22 , 23 , 25 , 27 – 29 , 31 , 36 , 37 studies. The 21 studies investigated 39 interventions (n = 15,129 pulse assessments), which were categorised as blood pressure monitors (BPMs) (six studies; seven interventions), 25 , 28 , 33 , 36 – 38 non-12-lead ECG (10 studies; 20 interventions), 9 , 19 – 22 , 24 , 25 , 31 , 32 , 35 pulse palpation (six studies; six interventions) 9 , 25 , 27 , 30 , 32 , 34 and smartphone applications (three studies; six interventions). 23 , 26 , 29 The five studies that were excluded due to insufficient reporting of outcome data investigated pulse palpation, pulse oximetry, smartphone applications and single-lead ECG as methods for detecting AF. Although the majority of studies avoided a case–controlled design, only four were prospective and seven studies were conducted in a primary care setting. 9 , 25 , 27 , 30 , 32 , 34 , 35 AF prevalence ranged from 5.7% to 25.4% in studies with a prospective design. 9 , 24 , 30 , 38 There was substantial variation in the proportion and/or prevalence of AF in studies within each category of detection method. Five studies excluded participants if they were less than 65 years of age and for two studies age of inclusion was 75 years. 9 , 25 , 27 , 32 – 34 , 38 Six studies included participants who were 18 years or older. 24 , 28 – 31 , 36 Ten studies excluded patients that had been fitted with pacemakers and/or implantable defibrillators. 22 , 25 , 27 , 28 , 33 , 35 – 38 For the majority of studies, the reference standard was 12-lead ECG interpreted by at least one trained physician/cardiologist. One study did not specify the training of the clinician interpreting reference ECGs. 19 Five studies reported other reference standards; 27 , 29 , 30 , 34 , 38 one study used either 12-lead ECG or ECGs derived from cardiac telemetry; 29 three studies used single or limb-lead ECG; 27 , 30 , 34 one study used ECGs derived from Holter monitors. 38 The methodological quality of included studies using QUADAS-2 criteria is presented in Figure 2 . Study quality was generally low. Using the additional quality grading system, we classified one study as A grade having met all QUADAS-2 criteria. 30 Eleven studies were graded category C or D. 9 , 19 , 21 – 23 , 27 , 29 , 32 – 34 , 36 Studies with the lowest methodological quality (D grade) were classified as this due to either the interpretation of the reference standard being unclear or at high risk of bias, or due to the index test being interpreted unblinded to the results of the reference standard. Category C studies were graded as such because it was unclear whether there was an appropriate time interval between the index test and reference standard. The remaining nine studies were categorised as grade B in methodological quality. 20 , 24 – 26 , 28 , 31 , 35 , 37 , 38 Figure 2. Study quality according to QUADAS-2 criteria. Study quality according to QUADAS-2 criteria. Forest plots for diagnostic accuracies of the four methods for detecting AF are presented (Appendices 4–7). BPMs had a pooled sensitivity of 0.98 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92–1) and specificity of 0.92 (95% CI 0.88–0.95); PLR of 12.1 (95% CI 8.2–17.8) and NLR of 0.02 (95% CI 0.00–0.09). There were similar diagnostic accuracies for studies that investigated smartphone applications, sensitivity 0.97 (95% CI 0.95–0.99), specificity 0.95 (95% CI 0.88–0.98), PLR 19 (95% CI 8–45), NLR 0.03 (95% CI 0.01–0.05); and non-12-lead ECGs, sensitivity 0.91 (95% CI 0.86–0.94), specificity 0.95 (95% CI 0.92–0.97), PLR 20.1 (95% CI 12–33.7), NLR 0.09 (95% CI 0.06–0.14). Although pulse palpation had a sensitivity that was comparable to the other methods for detecting suspected AF (sensitivity of 0.92; 95% CI 0.85–0.96), there was a substantially lower specificity for this method (specificity 0.82; 95% CI 0.76–0.88); PLR and NLR for pulse palpation were 5.2 (95% CI 3.8–7.2) and 0.1 (95% CI 0.05–0.18), respectively. SROC plots for the methods of detecting AF are presented in Figure 3 . Visual inspection of the plots confirms the accuracy of pulse palpation was lower than other methods for detecting AF. There was substantial variation in outcomes of the studies investigating non-12-lead ECG from the predicted receiver operating characteristic curve and suggests the heterogeneity among these studies was greatest. In contrast, the heterogeneity was lowest among studies that investigated smartphone applications for detecting AF. Figure 3.

There was no evidence of publication bias; Deeks’ funnel test P = 0.34, P = 0.11, P = 0.14 and P = 0.27 for studies investigating BPMs, non-12-lead ECG, smartphone applications and pulse palpation, respectively. There were only sufficient studies to perform bivariate subgroup analyses according to study quality for BPM, non-12-lead ECG and pulse palpation interventions. After the exclusion of studies with the lowest (D grade) quality, there were no substantial differences to the primary findings. (BPMs: sensitivity 0.96 (95% CI 0.91–0.98), specificity 0.93 (95% CI 0.89–0.96); non-12-lead ECG: sensitivity 0.92 (95% CI 0.86–0.95), specificity 0.94 (95% CI 0.91–0.97); pulse palpation: sensitivity 0.93 (95% CI 0.86–0.97), specificity 0.81 (95% CI 0.76–0.85).) Sufficient studies to perform bivariate subgroup analyses for primary care studies were available for pulse palpation and non-12-lead ECG interventions. The findings were similar to our primary analyses, although the specificity of non-12-lead ECGs was slightly lower (non-12-lead ECGs: sensitivity 0.91 (95% CI 0.83–0.95), specificity 0.89 (95% CI 0.85–0.92); pulse palpation: all studies were conducted in primary care and findings already presented above).Of the 21 studies included (Appendix 2), there were two randomised trials, 9 , 30 seven case–control, 20 , 21 , 26 , 32 – 35 two cohort 24 , 38 and 10 cross-sectional 19 , 22 , 23 , 25 , 27 – 29 , 31 , 36 , 37 studies.

Sufficient studies to perform bivariate subgroup analyses for primary care studies were available for pulse palpation and non-12-lead ECG interventions. The findings were similar to our primary analyses, although the specificity of non-12-lead ECGs was slightly lower (non-12-lead ECGs: sensitivity 0.91 (95% CI 0.83–0.95), specificity 0.89 (95% CI 0.85–0.92); pulse palpation: all studies were conducted in primary care and findings already presented above).This review of 21 studies for methods of detecting irregular pulses caused by AF found modified BPMs and non-12-lead ECG devices had the greatest diagnostic accuracy. Although the sensitivities of all methods for identifying those with AF were similar, the specificity of pulse palpation was substantially lower, which gives rise to more false positive test results. This study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of interventions for detecting suspected AF. A strength was the use of a protocol, consistent with guidelines for systematic reviews of diagnostic test studies. We used a comprehensive search strategy and our findings supported the lack of publication bias. It is therefore likely that we included small studies with less significant findings. Five studies were excluded from meta-analyses due to insufficient reporting of outcome data; outcomes that were reported from these studies were consistent with our pooled findings and the effect of their exclusion is likely to be minimal. Only four of the 21 included studies were prospective and there were a number of methodological weaknesses in most studies, as reflected by our assessments of study quality; only one study was judged to fulfil all QUADAS-2 criteria. Most studies were conducted in a secondary care setting and there was substantial variation in the proportion of patients with AF. This limits the generalisability of our findings to primary care populations that AF screening is intended for. As expected, there was heterogeneity among studies within all intervention categories and this is likely to be attributable to differences in study populations and design. Variation was greatest for studies investigating non-12-lead ECG for detecting AF. This may be due to differences in detection methods within this category as non-12-lead ECG interventions included single-lead, three-lead and reconstructed ECG. Furthermore, difference in healthcare professionals used to interpret ECGs is also likely to contribute to the heterogeneity within this intervention category. Guidance recommends pulse palpation as the first step for AF screening. 10 , 11 This method of identifying those with an irregular pulse was evaluated as part of two randomised trials in primary care; combined with confirmatory 12-lead ECG for diagnosing AF; these studies suggest this is an efficacious and cost-effective approach to screening. 9 , 30 More recently, studies have tended to evaluate alternative screening technologies. Our review identified four methods (non-12-lead ECG, BPMs, smartphone applications and pulse oximetry) as alternative methods for detecting pulse irregularities, although the latter method was not eligible for inclusion in our analyses. Of all interventions, pulse palpation had the lowest diagnostic accuracy for detecting pulse irregularities caused by AF, as reflected by its lower specificity. This could be due to differences in the threshold of each method to rule in or out AF; electronic methods, such as BPMs, use software algorithms to determine the severity of pulse irregularity and only those patients meeting a predetermined cut-off point are classified as having AF. In contrast, studies investigating pulse palpation required clinicians to classify the pulse as being regular or irregular. It is therefore conceivable that pulse palpation could result in greater false positive cases of suspected AF due to patients with transient pulse irregularities (e.g. ventricular extra-systoles) being referred for ECG testing, which software algorithms would have excluded. Although pulse palpation is considered a cheap and feasible method for detecting patients with an irregular pulse, 12 our review highlights the potential for alternative technologies to improve the identification of those with suspected AF. Any method of detecting pulse irregularities caused by AF should, in addition to being cheap, be quick, simple and accurate for it to be a cost-effective intervention in primary care. Recent guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advocates the use of automated BPMs for the detection of suspected AF in patients being screened or monitored for hypertension. 44 We found BPMs to have a substantially greater accuracy for detecting pulse irregularities caused by AF than pulse palpation; such devices are likely to be pragmatic alternatives to pulse palpation as blood pressure checks are an integral component of existing cardiovascular screening programmes in primary care. 45 Furthermore, automated devices would enable screening to be conducted by all healthcare professionals without the need for additional training. However, to date there have been no economic analyses comparing BPMs to pulse palpation for detecting suspected AF and this would help to inform optimal planning and service configurations of any future AF screening programme. Our review highlights the potential of smartphone applications for detecting suspected AF. This method had a similar diagnostic accuracy as BPMs. However, only three studies investigated this detection modality; two of these investigated multiple software algorithms in the same cohort of patients and all studies were small in sample size. This is likely to inflate our estimates of diagnostic accuracy for smartphone applications, and our findings should be interpreted with caution. However, if these findings are replicated in larger studies that represent those targeted by screening, this raises the possibility of using such technologies within both the clinic and home settings. The second stage of AF screening is diagnosing AF in patients with an irregular pulse. The gold standard test for diagnosing AF is 12-lead ECG interpreted by a competent professional. 8 , 11 The range and accuracies of methods for diagnosing AF using 12-lead ECG is not known. Indeed, optimising the accuracy of both stages to AF screening will help ensure the effectiveness of this intervention and planning of appropriate service configuration for delivering screening.This study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of interventions for detecting suspected AF. A strength was the use of a protocol, consistent with guidelines for systematic reviews of diagnostic test studies. We used a comprehensive search strategy and our findings supported the lack of publication bias. It is therefore likely that we included small studies with less significant findings. Five studies were excluded from meta-analyses due to insufficient reporting of outcome data; outcomes that were reported from these studies were consistent with our pooled findings and the effect of their exclusion is likely to be minimal. Only four of the 21 included studies were prospective and there were a number of methodological weaknesses in most studies, as reflected by our assessments of study quality; only one study was judged to fulfil all QUADAS-2 criteria. Most studies were conducted in a secondary care setting and there was substantial variation in the proportion of patients with AF. This limits the generalisability of our findings to primary care populations that AF screening is intended for. As expected, there was heterogeneity among studies within all intervention categories and this is likely to be attributable to differences in study populations and design. Variation was greatest for studies investigating non-12-lead ECG for detecting AF. This may be due to differences in detection methods within this category as non-12-lead ECG interventions included single-lead, three-lead and reconstructed ECG. Furthermore, difference in healthcare professionals used to interpret ECGs is also likely to contribute to the heterogeneity within this intervention category.Guidance recommends pulse palpation as the first step for AF screening. 10 , 11 This method of identifying those with an irregular pulse was evaluated as part of two randomised trials in primary care; combined with confirmatory 12-lead ECG for diagnosing AF; these studies suggest this is an efficacious and cost-effective approach to screening. 9 , 30 More recently, studies have tended to evaluate alternative screening technologies. Our review identified four methods (non-12-lead ECG, BPMs, smartphone applications and pulse oximetry) as alternative methods for detecting pulse irregularities, although the latter method was not eligible for inclusion in our analyses. Of all interventions, pulse palpation had the lowest diagnostic accuracy for detecting pulse irregularities caused by AF, as reflected by its lower specificity. This could be due to differences in the threshold of each method to rule in or out AF; electronic methods, such as BPMs, use software algorithms to determine the severity of pulse irregularity and only those patients meeting a predetermined cut-off point are classified as having AF. In contrast, studies investigating pulse palpation required clinicians to classify the pulse as being regular or irregular. It is therefore conceivable that pulse palpation could result in greater false positive cases of suspected AF due to patients with transient pulse irregularities (e.g. ventricular extra-systoles) being referred for ECG testing, which software algorithms would have excluded. Although pulse palpation is considered a cheap and feasible method for detecting patients with an irregular pulse, 12 our review highlights the potential for alternative technologies to improve the identification of those with suspected AF. Any method of detecting pulse irregularities caused by AF should, in addition to being cheap, be quick, simple and accurate for it to be a cost-effective intervention in primary care. Recent guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advocates the use of automated BPMs for the detection of suspected AF in patients being screened or monitored for hypertension. 44 We found BPMs to have a substantially greater accuracy for detecting pulse irregularities caused by AF than pulse palpation; such devices are likely to be pragmatic alternatives to pulse palpation as blood pressure checks are an integral component of existing cardiovascular screening programmes in primary care. 45 Furthermore, automated devices would enable screening to be conducted by all healthcare professionals without the need for additional training.

       "  'abstract_text': 'In contemporary atrial fibrillation trials most deaths are cardiac related, whereas stroke and bleeding represent only a small subset of deaths. We aimed to evaluate the long-term risk of cardiac events and all-cause mortality in individuals with atrial fibrillation compared to no atrial fibrillation. A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published between 1 January 2006 and 21 October 2016. Four databases were searched. Studies had follow-up of at least 500 stable patients for either cardiac endpoints or all-cause mortality for 12 months or longer. Publication bias was evaluated and random effects models were used to synthesise the results. Heterogeneity between studies was examined by subgroup and meta-regression analyses. A total of 15 cohort studies was included. Analyses indicated that atrial fibrillation was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (relative risk (RR) 1.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26–1.85), all-cause mortality (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.50–2.54) and heart failure (RR 4.62, 95% CI 3.13–6.83). Coronary heart disease at baseline was associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction and explained 57% of the heterogeneity. A prospective cohort design accounted for 25% of all-cause mortality heterogeneity. Due to there being fewer than 10 studies, sources of heterogeneity were inconclusive for heart failure. Atrial fibrillation seems to be associated with an increased risk of subsequent myocardial infarction in patients without coronary heart disease and an increased risk of, all-cause mortality and heart failure in patients with and without coronary heart disease.',\n",
       "  'article_text': 'Current treatment of thromboembolic complications associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) has mainly focused on the prevention of stroke. 1 , 2 Notwithstanding, patients with AF frequently develop coronary heart disease (CHD). Similar cardiovascular risk factors for CHD and AF have been suggested to reflect a common pathway of underlying vascular disease. 3 In a recent meta-analysis of patients with AF, cardiac deaths accounted for 46% of all deaths during follow-up, whereas non-haemorrhagic stroke/systemic embolism and haemorrhage-related deaths represented only 5.7% and 5.6% of the total mortality, respectively. 4 As part of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, 5 including participants free of CHD at baseline, AF was associated with a 63% increased risk of incident myocardial infarction (MI). These studies limited inclusion to either AF-only or CHD-free patients. The objective of the present systematic review was therefore to summarise the evidence from contemporary epidemiological studies, which included patients with predominantly sinus rhythm with or without CHD at baseline, examining the association between AF and the risk of major cardiac events (CEs) and mortality, followed by an evaluation of the influence of core patient-level characteristics such as age, gender and CHD at baseline.The review protocol has been registered at http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/ (reg. CRD42016033209). The manuscript was prepared according to the 2009 PRISMA checklist. 6 We selected randomised trials or observational studies of clinically stable patients that evaluated MI, heart failure (HF) and mortality as endpoints in AF patients versus patients without AF; both categories with or without preceding CHD. To reflect contemporary management in view of the large differences in risk and outcome as compared to earlier management strategies 7 we considered articles published between 1 January 2006 and 21 October 2016. In order to minimise the problems associated with small-scale studies, at least 500 participants who were haemodynamically stable on inclusion and followed for 12 months or longer were required. As the unfavourable prognosis of AF complicating an acute MI 8 and cardiac surgery 9 is well established, studies selected had to have included patients who had sustained an MI or coronary artery bypass graft operation (CABG) more than 30 days prior to inclusion. Studies recruiting patients with acute AF at baseline were excluded, as were outcome studies comparing the prognostic impact of rate versus rhythm control in AF patients. We searched the databases Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library and Pubmed (including articles published ahead of print). Our search strategy combined text words and subject headings, with details presented in Supplementary Appendix 1. Two investigators independently evaluated studies for eligibility. Discrepancies were solved by repeated review and discussion. Reference lists were scrutinised to detect studies overlooked by the search. Data were extracted according to an a priori protocol registering the mean age of the cohort, frequency of men, CHD status at baseline, study design, median follow-up period and main results from multivariate analysis. The study quality was assessed by evaluating design characteristics using the Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS) for cohort studies. 10 The checklist includes core domains to assess: (a) methods for selecting study participant; (b) appropriate control for confounding (comparability); and (c) methods assessing outcome variables. The diagnosis of AF should have been based upon electrocardiographic criteria and supported by hospital discharge letters and other available medical records. Objective criteria for CHD were: a confirmed hospitalisation for MI, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or CABG, a clinical diagnosis of angina pectoris verified by a positive stress test, or significant coronary artery stenosis on a coronary angiogram. Outcomes should have been verified from hospital records. Endpoint MI was defined as pure MI according to current standards, although the composite endpoints CEs (MI, angina pectoris, PCI or CABG), major CEs (coronary death and non-fatal MI) and cardiovascular events (composite of CEs (MI, acute and subacute ischaemic heart disease, CABG or PCI), cerebrovascular events (occlusion/stenosis of the precerebral/cerebral arteries or subarachnoid haemorrhage) and peripheral events (vascular interventions)) were accepted for the studies by Ruigomez et al., 11 Marte et al. 12 and Vermond et al., 13 respectively. To calculate an overall relative risk (RR) we used the effect estimates and its 95% confidence interval (CI) given from multivariable analysis, and a standard random effects meta-analysis. 14 The magnitude of between-study heterogeneity was evaluated by the I 2 statistics. I 2 values of 25%, 50% and 75% indicate low, moderate and high heterogeneity. 15 To investigate possible sources of heterogeneity, we performed analyses stratified by the patient characteristic CHD at baseline, and the study characteristic prospective versus retrospective timing of the study. Univariable random effects meta-regression analyses were used to examine whether effect estimates were affected by these covariates as well as by the patient covariates mean age of the cohort and frequency of men. The proportion of heterogeneity explained by the covariates was calculated by comparing the estimated between-study variance, τ 2 , with its value when no covariates were fitted. For power consideration we needed a minimum of 10 studies per covariate in a single model of meta-regression. 16 Sensitivity analyses were conducted by omitting one study in turn from the meta-analysis and assessing its effect on the overall results. 17 Publication bias was assessed using Egger’s test, which can be used only when at least 10 studies are included in the meta-analysis. 18 The analyses were performed using STATA 13.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).We selected randomised trials or observational studies of clinically stable patients that evaluated MI, heart failure (HF) and mortality as endpoints in AF patients versus patients without AF; both categories with or without preceding CHD.

Excluding duplicate publications and irrelevant content, 15 publications (18 studies) met our inclusion criteria. 5 , 11 – 13 , 19 – 29 The flow of information is presented in Supplementary Appendix 2. Goto et al. 26 reported results from a CHD population (Goto_RCHD) and a risk factor-only population (Goto_RRFO). Otterstad et al. 27 reported results for patients with prevalent AF (Otterstad_APAF) and incident AF (Otterstad_AIAF). Andersson et al. 29 presented results separately for men and women. The studies comprised a total of 220,928 participants, of whom 17.5% were exposed to AF ( Table 1 ). The median age was 63 years (range 47–72), 59% were men (range 0–100), median follow-up was 4.9 years (range 1–21.6). CHD at baseline was present in eight studies (criteria for ruling CHD out are presented in Supplementary Appendix 3). All studies were cohort designs, eight with prospective timing. Confounding by age, gender, baseline cardiovascular disease and cardiac risk factors was adjusted for in multivariate analysis (Supplementary Appendix 4). In general, the studies were judged as being of a good quality (Supplementary Appendix 5). Table 2 presents inclusion criteria, study design, risk estimates and treatment with oral anticoagulants (OACs), which was reported in five studies of CHD patients, ranging from 25% to 57%, and in two for studies of patients without CHD range 1.3% to 19.9%. Comorbidity details are presented in Supplementary Appendix 6. In general, AF patients were older, had more cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities, higher body mass index and worse kidney function than non-AF patients. The pooled estimate including 16 studies ( Figure 1(a) ) showed an increased risk of MI in subjects with AF as compared to no AF (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.28–1.85, I 2 = 80.9%). CHD at baseline and the frequency of men were associated with a reduced risk of MI and explained 57% and 26% of heterogeneity, respectively ( Tables 3 and 4 ). Furthermore, the timing of the study was borderline significant and explained 11% of heterogeneity. The effect of these three covariates was not investigated simultaneously in meta-regression both due to the correlation between CHD and gender ( R = 0.5325) and few studies. In sensitivity analyses the results appeared to be robust to the influence of individual studies (Supplementary Appendix 7(a)). Publication bias was not indicated (Egger test, P = 0.967). Figure 1.

Publication bias was not examined given the number of studies.Prevalent and incident AF appear to be significantly associated with MI, HF and all-cause mortality. Meta-regression analyses indicated that heterogeneity could be explained by patient and study characteristics related to the presence or absence of CHD, gender and study design being retrospective or prospective. For the endpoint MI, heterogeneity was first of all explained by pre-existing CHD; AF patients without pre-existent CHD demonstrated a significantly higher risk of MI when compared to non-AF patients as opposed to stable CHD patients. We judged all included studies to be of satisfactory methodological quality. A retrospective design was a major limitation and differences in data quality might explain the tendency towards a higher risk of all endpoints related to a prospective design, as seen in Table 3 . This review is based on a comprehensive literature search designed to avoid a large heterogeneity related to comorbidities and acute stage scenarios of CHD manifestations and interventions, and the meta-analysis is based on comprehensively study-level adjusted estimates. However, the probability of unmeasured confounding cannot be excluded in observational studies. In a very recent meta-analysis of cohort studies, Odutayo et al. 30 reported an increased risk for a range of different outcomes when exposed to AF, with a high level of heterogeneity. In contrast to our study, not only stable individuals with or without CHD were included, but also a variety of study populations, such as post-acute MI and post-cardiac surgery. The present meta-analysis differs substantially, as we have narrowed the spectra of patient inclusions and performed a literature search which includes text words and subject headings. Odutayo et al. did not provide detailed information on OACs given to patients with versus without CHD, but sensitivity analysis revealed lower all-cause mortality in studies with a higher proportion of participants receiving OACs. In a recent meta-analysis of 12 studies, Guo et al. 31 reported the same increased risk of MI in AF patients as in the present study. The risk of HF and death was not studied. Interestingly, and in line with the present study, AF was associated with a significantly increased risk of MI in patients free from CHD at baseline. Stroke prevention is a major public health priority 32 and it is of interest that a greater proportion of CHD patients were treated with an OAC than CHD-free patients, which might be explanatory for their reduced risk of MI as seen in both the study of Guo et al. and in the present analysis. Supporting the trend towards a higher female risk of MI among AF patients in our study. Emdin et al. 33 reported an association with a higher risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events in women. This systematic review/meta-analysis demonstrates a relationship between AF and an increased risk of CEs and mortality, but causal evidence cannot be established. In a recent study, the presence of AF has been shown to be independently associated with a heightened risk of MI despite a lower baseline burden and progression rate of coronary atheroma. 34 Similar cardiovascular risk factors of AF and MI may reflect a common pathway of underlying disease and act as confounders such that AF may not be regarded as a causal risk factor for MI, HF and death, but a surrogate of more severe disease. In view of this, Wijesurendra et al. 35 performed magnetic resonance imaging before and after catheter ablation for AF, and stated that AF may be the consequence (rather than the cause) of an occult cardiomyopathy which persists despite a significant reduction in AF burden after ablation.AF seems to be associated with an increased risk of subsequent MI in patients without CHD and with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and HF whatever the coronary status. However, AF should not be regarded as a causal risk factor for these conditions.',\n",

These strokes are largely preventable by the use of anticoagulation therapy, although many eligible patients are not treated. Recent large clinical trials have added to the evidence base on stroke prevention and international clinical guidelines have been updated. Consensus practical recommendations from primary care physicians with an interest in vascular disease and vascular specialists. A focussed all-day meeting, with presentation of summary evidence under each section of this guidance and review of European guidelines on stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, was used to generate a draft document, which then underwent three cycles of revision and debate before all panel members agreed with the consensus statements. Six areas were identified that included how to identify patients with atrial fibrillation, how to determine their stroke risk and whether to recommend modification of this risk, and what management options are available, with practical recommendations on maximising benefit and minimising risk if anticoagulation is recommended and the reasons why antiplatelet therapy is no longer recommended. The summary evidence is presented for each area and simple summary recommendations are highlighted, with areas of remaining uncertainty listed. Atrial fibrillation-related stroke is a major public health priority for most health systems. This practical guidance can assist generalist community physicians to translate the large evidence base for this cause of preventable stroke and implement this at a local level.',\n",
       "  'article_text': 'Despite the large evidence base for preventing stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF), and the recent guideline updates with recent clinical outcome data and clinical experience (see web version for full details and references), the European Primary Cardiovascular Care Society (EPCCS) felt that wider implementation of the available guidelines (European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and others) in primary care settings would benefit from adding contextual changes or clarifications of the evidence to aid the uptake of guidance in primary care. The EPCCS therefore established a Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) working group to develop an evidence-guided pragmatic guide on SPAF in primary care. The EPCCS Consensus Group made its recommendations based on ‘the trade-off between the benefits and harms of any intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence’. The wording used in our recommendations (see Box 1 ) denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation). There should be discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits of the interventions, and their values and preferences. This discussion aims to help clinician and patient to reach a fully informed decision. Box 1. Strength of recommendations The following colour coding will be used throughout the document, to indicate the strength of the individual recommendations. Interventions that should (or should not) be used: a ‘strong’ recommendation ‘Offer’ (and similar words such as ‘refer’ or ‘advise’) indicates confidence that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost-effective. Similar forms of words (for example, ‘Do not offer…’) are used when we are confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients. Interventions that could be used ‘Consider’ indicates confidence that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost-effective, but other options may be similarly cost-effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient’s values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.

To highlight the summary recommendations, the writing committee chose to indicate where the position taken is clearly evidence-based (green), and where it is more inferred and consensus-based (blue). It is also specified when studies were carried out in primary care settings, and therefore the evidence is most relevant.Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, with about 1–2% of the general population estimated to be affected. 1 , 2 It is a particularly common disorder in the elderly, with over 5% of people over the age of 65 suffering from AF, and around 10% of people over the age of 75. 3 – 5 As a consequence of the ageing population, the prevalence of AF is predicted to rise. 6 Rising prevalence has also been attributed to better survival of patients following acute coronary events, and a greater awareness among healthcare professionals of the importance of diagnosing AF. Patients with AF may have symptoms such as palpitations, lack of energy, dizziness, chest discomfort and shortness of breath, which may impair quality of life. 7 The degree of these symptoms varies considerably, from patients who are completely asymptomatic to those who are quite disabled by the arrhythmia. The use of rate and rhythm control to improve symptoms is beyond the scope of this guideline, which will focus exclusively on stroke prevention. It is important to note that, for many patients with AF, the condition is often asymptomatic - or associated with minor symptoms that are ignored or unrecognised by patients -- therefore, if the arrhythmia is to be identified in all, some type of AF screening is needed. Perhaps the most important consequence of AF is the risk of embolic stroke. Patients with AF are at an almost fivefold higher risk of stroke compared with age-matched individuals with normal sinus rhythm, as shown in the Framingham study, 8 as well as at a twice as high risk of all-cause mortality and heart failure. About 20--25% of all ischaemic strokes are attributable to embolism as a result of AF. 9 Not only do patients with AF have more strokes, they also develop more recurrent strokes, both fatal and nonfatal. 8 In addition, strokes are likely to be more severe in patients with AF, than in patients who have a stroke not associated with AF, regardless of age. 10 Following a stroke, patients with AF are more likely to be left with long-term disability and may require long-term care. 11 , 12 This disability is a major source of concern for patients and is associated with high costs for healthcare systems. Moreover, AF is often associated with other underlying pathology, such as cardiovascular comorbidity (coronary artery disease, heart failure, hypertension) and/or non-cardiovascular comorbidity (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), renal failure, etc.). This is especially prevalent in the elderly, and highlights the role general practice should play in managing this multi-morbid disorder. AF has considerable impact on individuals and health systems. It is also associated with increased mortality, heart failure and high rates of hospitalisation because of stroke. Admission and readmission rates are the most important factors driving healthcare expenditure. 18 – 20 ESC guidelines distinguish various types of AF, mainly based on duration, for example paroxysmal (usually ≤48 hours), persistent (≥7 days) and long-standing or permanent (>1 year). 1 , 2 These classifications are somewhat arbitrary and their use in clinical practice might be limited. They may, however, be relevant to determine how to treat the arrhythmia itself, rather than the stroke risk associated with AF. The risk of stroke is considered similar for all types of AF. 13 It is also important to consider the distinction between valvular and non-valvular types of AF, as this affects management. In the ESC guidelines, 1 , 2 the term valvular AF is used to indicate that AF is related to rheumatic valvular disease (predominantly mitral stenosis) or prosthetic heart valves. Atrial flutter, a different type of atrial arrhythmia, is sometimes considered along with AF. Patients with atrial flutter are often referred for consideration of curative management, but in the meantime stroke risk should be considered and managed in the same way as AF. In summary, all types of AF, with the exception of clinically significant valvular AF as defined above, should be regarded as the same in terms of stroke risk. Defining the type of AF can provide a diagnostic label, which can be useful when considering rate or rhythm management, but stroke risk is similar. Importantly, re-establishing sinus rhythm will not remove the stroke risk. 14 – 17 AF often co-exists with other chronic diseases, and these comorbidities may have caused or exacerbated each other. Over extended periods of time, AF may cause substantial cardiac remodelling that can impact on the management of both conditions. A recent epidemiological study showed that 5% of over 65-year-olds had AF, and at least three other chronic conditions. 21 This implies that the general practitioner can play a crucial, central role, as he or she is aware of and can manage different conditions. Based on current evidence and experience, we recommend the following in a primary care setting: All patients with AF, regardless of AF type, are at increased risk of stroke as they age or develop certain comorbid conditions and therefore all AF patients should be offered assessment of their stroke risk (see How to decide whether to treat stroke risk in atrial fibrillation?). Patients who are treated for AF and returned to sinus rhythm should be risk assessed as if they were still in AF and should remain on their stroke prevention therapy if it was indicated prior to rhythm control. If a decision is taken to stop anticoagulation in these patients, it should be a specialist decision.

AF meets all the Wilson-Jungner criteria to be a condition worth screening for. Patients with AF may present with symptoms, and AF should be considered in anyone complaining of palpitations (fluttering or irregular heart beat), dizziness or fainting spells, chest discomfort, shortness of breath and/or reduced exercise tolerance. However, not all patients with AF will have symptoms and may, therefore, be unaware they have an arrhythmia. The observation that even short episodes of silent AF (as measured with implanted devices and by Holter electrocardiograms (ECGs)) convey an increased risk of stroke 22 , 23 offers the rationale for opportunistic screening. Opportunistic screening by pulse palpation in general practice detected a large number of patients with previously undiagnosed AF compared with usual care (1.64% per year by screening vs. 1.04% per year with care as usual), yielding a feasible number of 169 needed to screen. 24 These data suggest that active screening for AF in patients of 65 years and older can identify patients eligible for anticoagulation treatment according to CHADS 2 criteria. 25 New technologies, such as modified sphygmomanometers capable of detecting an irregular pulse, may also improve pick-up rates. In patients with suspected AF, an ECG, preferably 12-lead ECG, can confirm the diagnosis. Loss of P-waves and completely irregular R-R distances are characteristic features of AF on ECG; however, ECG changes may be subtle, so judgement by a competent ECG-reader is required to confidently diagnose AF. 5 Adequate interpretation of a single-lead ECG may be considered as convincing as a 12-lead ECG for detection or exclusion of AF. 26 Conventionally, an ECG should contain a total of 30 seconds of AF to confirm the diagnosis, but this criterion is consensus not evidence-based, and was developed for considering which patients to offer cardioversion or pacing. Therefore, a standard 12-lead ECG of 10 seconds is perhaps sufficient in practice settings. Based on current evidence and experiences, we recommend the following case finding efforts in a primary care setting: Interventions that should be used Opportunistic case finding should be carried out for timely detection of AF in all patients over 65 years of age, and in anyone who receives routine cardiovascular follow-up: ○ Pulse palpation, at least once a year could be incorporated into already existing medical visits, for instance during an annual cardiac disease review, and/or at flu vaccinations or pharmacy visits. In the case of a positive pulse palpation: ○ 12-lead ECG follow-up should be performed shortly after pulse assessment. 12-lead ECG follow-up should be done by a practitioner who is competent in ECG interpretation.

Additional work recommended in this area/gaps in the evidence: See web version See web versionWhen giving antithrombotic agents to reduce stroke risk in AF, both thromboembolic risk and bleeding risk need to be considered. ‘Whom not to treat?’ is a question at least as important to ask as ‘whom to treat?’, as each form of antithrombotic therapy has an inherent, and possibly severe, bleeding risk. The CHADS 2 score is a valuable tool that has been used for some time to assess stroke risk in patients with AF, 27 , 28 but observational data highlighted the need for a more robust stroke risk score. The CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score has since been developed, which includes additional risk factors and gives a maximum score of 9 compared with a maximum of 6 in the CHADS 2 score (see Table 1 for components of the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score). Age can contribute 2 points, rather than 1, if the patient is ≥75 years old. Vascular disease and female sex also add an extra point, 1 , 2 the latter only contributing a score, however, if other stroke risk factors are present (i.e. if the only ‘risk’ factor is being female, the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score is 0). The improved risk stratification with CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc as opposed to CHADS 2 score has been validated in several studies, 29 – 33 and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc is the recommended score for assessment of stroke risk in the ESC guidelines. 2 Event rates of hospital admission and death caused by thromboembolism (including peripheral artery embolism, ischaemic stroke, and pulmonary embolism) for each CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc category are shown in Table 2 . Bleeding is an important, potentially serious, side effect of anticoagulation and should be considered for all patients prior to treatment initiation. Bleeding risk can be assessed with the HAS-BLED score, as introduced in the 2010 ESC Guidelines (see Table 3 for components of the HAS-BLED score). 1 , 34 The score takes into account nine risk factors for bleeding that should be considered before starting antithrombotic treatment. The most important factor determining both stroke and bleeding risk appears to be age, 2 , 35 – 38 which justifies its double weight in the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score. An observational retrospective study has confirmed increased bleeding rates in incremental HAS-BLED scores. 35 Table 4 shows the incidence of major bleeding per HAS-BLED category as seen in non-selected patients receiving anticoagulation. HAS-BLED should guide the patient and clinician to reduce modifiable bleeding risks (namely high blood pressure, liver and kidney function, INR control and use of interacting medications or alcohol), but not determine whether to offer anticoagulation or not – that decision is based on stroke risk estimation. Falls are sometimes given as an argument not to anticoagulate a frail patient, yet evidence suggests that patients with low impact falls need to fall a great number of times before it actually increases the bleeding risk. Patient preferences should determine treatment; some patients are willing to endure many bleeds to avoid one stroke and its consequences, whereas others may accept stroke risk rather than the inconvenience of taking anticoagulants. 39 In general, it should be noted that with an area under the curve below 70, 38 , 40 , 41 these risk scores remain less than perfect predictors of individual risk. Based on current evidence and experiences, we recommend the following stroke and bleeding risk assessment strategy in primary care in patients who have been diagnosed with AF: Stroke and bleeding risk interventions that should be used CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score is superior to CHADS 2 score for assessing stroke risk in AF, notably in identifying those that should not receive anticoagulation. Alternatively, as CHADS 2 is simpler to use, patients’ risk of stroke can be initially assessed using CHADS 2 but if their score is 1 or less, then a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASC score should be performed to identify those patients who do not require anticoagulation. Patients with a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 0 should not be offered antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy. Patients with a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 2 or above should be offered anticoagulation. In patients with a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 1, consider anticoagulation and base any decision to treat or not treat on patient preference after balancing the benefits with risks of treatment. As a second step, HAS-BLED should be used to assess bleeding risk, with the aim of modifying this risk through addressing individual risk factors that can be altered. HAS-BLED should not be used to decide whether to offer anticoagulation in someone with a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 2 or above, but consider its use to balance the benefits of anticoagulation in patients with a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 1. On a regular basis, and at least once a year, the risk status of patients with AF should be re-evaluated depending on change in risk factors (change of age category, new hypertension, etc). These scoring tools are available on the EPCCS website at: www.epccs.eu . CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score is superior to CHADS 2 score for assessing stroke risk in AF, notably in identifying those that should not receive anticoagulation. Alternatively, as CHADS 2 is simpler to use, patients’ risk of stroke can be initially assessed using CHADS 2 but if their score is 1 or less, then a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASC score should be performed to identify those patients who do not require anticoagulation. Patients with a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 0 should not be offered antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy. Patients with a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 2 or above should be offered anticoagulation.

Alternative risk assessment approaches that may be used: A more pragmatic strong risk application might simply be to consider age, as women over 65 with AF and an additional risk factor qualify for anticoagulation according to CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk stratification, and so do men over 75. People under 65 with no additional risk factor to their AF, in contrast, do not need anticoagulation. Risk assessment should also be done in patients younger than 65 years of age who have multiple risk factors.

See web version.When giving antithrombotic agents to reduce stroke risk in AF, both thromboembolic risk and bleeding risk need to be considered. ‘Whom not to treat?’ is a question at least as important to ask as ‘whom to treat?’, as each form of antithrombotic therapy has an inherent, and possibly severe, bleeding risk. The CHADS 2 score is a valuable tool that has been used for some time to assess stroke risk in patients with AF, 27 , 28 but observational data highlighted the need for a more robust stroke risk score. The CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score has since been developed, which includes additional risk factors and gives a maximum score of 9 compared with a maximum of 6 in the CHADS 2 score (see Table 1 for components of the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score). Age can contribute 2 points, rather than 1, if the patient is ≥75 years old. Vascular disease and female sex also add an extra point, 1 , 2 the latter only contributing a score, however, if other stroke risk factors are present (i.e. if the only ‘risk’ factor is being female, the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score is 0). The improved risk stratification with CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc as opposed to CHADS 2 score has been validated in several studies, 29 – 33 and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc is the recommended score for assessment of stroke risk in the ESC guidelines. 2 Event rates of hospital admission and death caused by thromboembolism (including peripheral artery embolism, ischaemic stroke, and pulmonary embolism) for each CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc category are shown in Table 2 .Bleeding is an important, potentially serious, side effect of anticoagulation and should be considered for all patients prior to treatment initiation. Bleeding risk can be assessed with the HAS-BLED score, as introduced in the 2010 ESC Guidelines (see Table 3 for components of the HAS-BLED score). 1 , 34 The score takes into account nine risk factors for bleeding that should be considered before starting antithrombotic treatment. The most important factor determining both stroke and bleeding risk appears to be age, 2 , 35 – 38 which justifies its double weight in the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score. An observational retrospective study has confirmed increased bleeding rates in incremental HAS-BLED scores. 35 Table 4 shows the incidence of major bleeding per HAS-BLED category as seen in non-selected patients receiving anticoagulation. HAS-BLED should guide the patient and clinician to reduce modifiable bleeding risks (namely high blood pressure, liver and kidney function, INR control and use of interacting medications or alcohol), but not determine whether to offer anticoagulation or not – that decision is based on stroke risk estimation. Falls are sometimes given as an argument not to anticoagulate a frail patient, yet evidence suggests that patients with low impact falls need to fall a great number of times before it actually increases the bleeding risk. Patient preferences should determine treatment; some patients are willing to endure many bleeds to avoid one stroke and its consequences, whereas others may accept stroke risk rather than the inconvenience of taking anticoagulants. 39 In general, it should be noted that with an area under the curve below 70, 38 , 40 , 41 these risk scores remain less than perfect predictors of individual risk.Based on current evidence and experiences, we recommend the following stroke and bleeding risk assessment strategy in primary care in patients who have been diagnosed with AF: Stroke and bleeding risk interventions that should be used CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score is superior to CHADS 2 score for assessing stroke risk in AF, notably in identifying those that should not receive anticoagulation.

See web version.Different antithrombotic strategies to prevent stroke in AF have been investigated over time. Early studies suggested that antiplatelet agents were effective in reducing stroke risk with one meta-analysis showing that acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) reduced the stroke rate by 22%, 42 and addition of clopidogrel led to a risk reduction of 28%. 43 Vitamin K antagonists show risk reductions of 66%. 44 , 45 The BAFTA study specifically studied an elderly (≥75 years old) primary care population, and compared warfarin with ASA in a randomised controlled trial, showing that warfarin was much more effective than ASA at reducing stroke (see Table 5 ). Strokes occurring in the elderly are more likely to be embolic strokes. 46 The BAFTA data are supported by the individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of the totality of available warfarin and aspirin data in preventing AF stroke by age, which showed that aspirin became less effective and more likely to cause bleeding with increasing age, with no benefits observed beyond age 75. 47 Patients with AF often have other chronic conditions, which may be a cause or consequence of the arrhythmia or simply co-exist. Multi-morbidity increases with age, and is common in people over 65 years old. Patients between 65 and 84 were found to have on average 2.6 (SD 2.09) morbidities, and 64.9% (95% CI 64.7–65.1) of people in this age group have multi-morbidity. In patients of 85 years and older the mean number of morbidities is 3.62 (SD 2.30), and 81.5% (95% CI 81.1–81.9) of individuals have multi-morbidity. Socioeconomic deprivation is associated with earlier onset of multi-morbidity. 21 In symptomatic AF patients, it is important to optimise and control heart rate and it may also be appropriate to try to re-establish and maintain sinus-rhythm. Now that all guidelines advocate consideration of the use of antithrombotic therapy in all patients based on risk calculation, it is important to consider that control of rate and rhythm should only be attempted alongside controlling for the stroke risk. Importantly, antithrombotic therapy should be continued, even if rhythm control is obtained. 14 – 17 Based on current evidence and experiences, we recommend the following stroke risk reduction management in primary care patients who have been diagnosed with AF: Management strategies that should be used Patients with a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 2 or above should be offered anticoagulation. Patients with a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 2 or above should be offered anticoagulation. Management strategies that should not be used Patients assessed as low risk on the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score (0) should not be offered antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy, but may be offered standard advice regarding improving vascular risk factors (smoking cessation, BP and cholesterol control). Patients with a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 1, should not be offered single antiplatelet therapy. Patients at high stroke risk, with a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 2 or more, should not be offered single or dual antiplatelet therapy. Patients assessed as low risk on the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score (0) should not be offered antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy, but may be offered standard advice regarding improving vascular risk factors (smoking cessation, BP and cholesterol control).

In this situation, the decision to treat with anticoagulation or not should be based on patient preferences of their primary desire to reduce their stroke risk or to avoid bleeding risk. As their stroke risk is moderate rather than high, it is also very important to attempt to modify any bleeding risk factors. Only in those intolerant of, or declining, anticoagulation may a combination of antiplatelets be considered (although the bleeding risk of this strategy will approach that of anticoagulation).

VKAs require intensive monitoring of international normalised ratio (INR) to ensure the drug is effective yet safe by maintaining figures within a therapeutic range (INR target 2.5, range 2–3 for NVAF). Moreover, it is important to achieve INR control above 65% time in therapeutic range (TTR), as shown in Figure 1 . Four new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are now available, namely dabigatran etexilate, a direct thrombin inhibitor, 48 , 49 and the direct factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, 50 rivaroxaban, 51 and edoxaban. 51 , 52 These newer agents offer additional options to current treatments for SPAF, as outlined below. Figure 1. Percent of patients free from stroke over time, stratified by time spent in therapeutic range (INR 2.0–3.0). Adapted from Gallagher et al., Thromb and Haem 2011. 60 Percent of patients free from stroke over time, stratified by time spent in therapeutic range (INR 2.0–3.0). Adapted from Gallagher et al., Thromb and Haem 2011. 60 In recent years, new classes of anticoagulants have been developed and tested. Data of large trials on their efficacy and safety have been evaluated extensively, including ‘real life’ follow-up data. In several, large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of AF patients without severe valve disease or mechanical valves, NOACs have been shown to be effective at reducing stroke risk. 48 – 52 These RCTs were designed as non-inferiority studies; thus powered to show that NOACs are at least as good as warfarin in the prevention of stroke in AF. Fuller study details are available in the web version of this paper. A systematic review 53 that evaluated the results of the NOAC versus warfarin trials (RE-LY, ROCKET-AF and ARISTOTLE) concluded that overall mortality was decreased in patients with AF taking NOACs (risk difference estimated to be 8 fewer deaths per 1000 patients, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82–0.96). In the meta-analysis that also included ENGAGE AF-TIMI, all-cause mortality was also significantly reduced with NOACs (2022 events in 29292 patients ) versus warfarin (2245 events in 29221 patients , RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.85–0.95, p =0.0003). 54 Anticoagulation comes with an inherent bleeding risk, thus bleeding events were closely monitored and documented in the NOAC trials. When combining all data of the first three large trials, namely RELY, ROCKET-AF and ARISTOTLE, on direct thrombin inhibitors and Factor Xa inhibitors, fatal bleeds were found to be significantly reduced in comparison with anticoagulation with warfarin (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46–0.77, estimated risk difference is 1 fewer death per 1000 patients). Reduction in major bleeds did not reach statistical significance (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.63–1.01), 45 , 53 but a substantial reduction in intracranial haemorrhage was observed (204 events in 29287 patients on NOAC versus 425 events in 29211 patients on warfarin, RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.39–0.59, p <0.0001). 52 , 54 The data of individual trials are summarised in Table 9 in the web version of this paper. The meta-analysis of all NOAC RCTs also showed that NOACs were associated with a higher rate of GI bleeds (751 events in 29287 patients on NOACs vs. 591 events in 29211 warfarin-treated patients, RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.01–1.55, p =0.0430). 52 Meta-analyses of the NOAC trials did not find a difference in the rate of MI with NOACs versus warfarin on combined data of all trials evaluated (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.81–1.11, 53 and RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.78–1.20 52 ). The recent RE-ALIGN study reported that dabigatran should not be used in patients with mechanical heart valves, as more thromboembolic and bleeding events were observed in patients on dabigatran than in the warfarin-treated patients (to a higher target INR than in NVAF). The same contraindication is currently extended to all NOACs in this ‘high flow’ setting. Although there are no specific antidotes yet for NOACs, nonspecific reversal strategies, such as administration of prothrombin complex or recombinant factor VII, may be applied. A large advantage of NOACs in comparison with VKAs is that NOACs have a much shorter half-life. Thus, the duration of the effect is much shorter, thereby decreasing the need for an antidote. Clinical impact of major bleeds, as seen by, for instance, mortality, or the need for hospitalisation or intensive care unit stay, indeed appears to be less with the new oral anticoagulants than with VKAs, despite the fact that an antidote exists for the latter. 55 Specific antidotes are currently under development, such as an antibody against dabigatran 56 and recombinant factor Xa. 57 Severe chronic kidney disease, defined as an eGFR<30 ml/min or <15 ml/min depending on type of NOAC, is a contraindication to NOAC use. There are limited trial data for VKA and NOACs in frail elderly patients. Although NOACs may still be more expensive than VKA, INR monitoring is also expensive. Logistics and available resources may vary between countries or by region and will determine specific cost-effect balances. Cost-effectiveness of AF-related stroke prevention strategies is being explored, and efforts are dedicated to determine the impact of NOACs on health economics. Available evidence suggests that NOACs are cost-effective alternatives to warfarin with regard to efficacy and safety, although the final balance will depend on individual healthcare settings. 58 Comparisons between NOACs are emerging, but are based on indirect comparisons. Because of the shorter half-life of NOACs compared with VKAs, compliance is very important. It is therefore vital for physicians to emphasise the need for daily treatment adherence. An advantage of NOACs may lie in their fixed dose, compared with VKA doses that need to be adjusted based on INR measurements. However, this lack of need for monitoring drug levels reinforces the importance of stressing drug adherence with patients. It should not be underestimated that although the new agents are more convenient, they are still powerful anticoagulants. A dosage box with all medications to dispense may facilitate compliance (although not for dabigatran which requires original packaging). Rivaroxaban needs to be taken with food as taking it on an empty stomach may reduce therapeutic drug levels by up to 40%. Observational studies comparing the actual impact of NOAC use in daily clinical care are now emerging; some show similar and comparable results on the efficacy and safety of NOAC use. From a primary care perspective, such observational studies will help show efficacy and safety of NOAC use in frail elderly patients not included in the large trials. In summary, NOACs are at least as safe as VKA. Barriers for implementation still exist but these may improve with the growing body of trial data on safety and subgroup analyses. Moreover, generalisability may expand as a result of having more registries. In addition, growing confidence in reversal strategies should facilitate implementation. Based on current evidence and experiences, we recommend the following anticoagulation treatment strategy in a primary care setting: Management strategies that should be used All AF patients at high risk of stroke should be offered anticoagulation. In patients with mechanical valves or severe valve disease (defined by a specialist), this anticoagulation should be high-intensity VKA. For patients with AF but without mechanical valves or clinically significant valve disease, both warfarin, to adjusted INR target of 2.5, and NOACs are anticoagulant options. NOACs may represent a more convenient, at least as safe, and at least equally as effective option in the prevention of stroke in AF compared with VKAs. Treatment adherence is an important issue with NOAC use. Thus, on the basis of these issues, as well as cost and access, NOACs and VKAs both represent good treatment options for SPAF. Patients should be fully counselled, including written information, on the risks and benefits of anticoagulation or on changing to or initiating a NOAC. Patient preferences should guide decision-making over whether to initiate anticoagulation, and on what to prescribe, including estimation of a patient’s compliance. The patient groups in whom use of a NOAC is preferable to warfarin are patients who are unable or unwilling to take warfarin, and patients who are difficult to maintain at a stable INR (less than 65% time in therapeutic range). If prescribing NOACs, the importance of treatment adherence must be emphasised. Compliance may be facilitated with the use of a dosage box, except for dabigatran which should only be dispensed in its original packaging (although dabigatran is available in blister packages so, if desired, individual doses can be cut out with their original blister preserved and put in dosage box).

Management strategies that may be used ASA alone has no role in SPAF.

The meta-analysis of all NOAC RCTs also showed that NOACs were associated with a higher rate of GI bleeds (751 events in 29287 patients on NOACs vs. 591 events in 29211 warfarin-treated patients, RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.01–1.55, p =0.0430). 52 Meta-analyses of the NOAC trials did not find a difference in the rate of MI with NOACs versus warfarin on combined data of all trials evaluated (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.81–1.11, 53 and RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.78–1.20 52 ).The recent RE-ALIGN study reported that dabigatran should not be used in patients with mechanical heart valves, as more thromboembolic and bleeding events were observed in patients on dabigatran than in the warfarin-treated patients (to a higher target INR than in NVAF). The same contraindication is currently extended to all NOACs in this ‘high flow’ setting.Although there are no specific antidotes yet for NOACs, nonspecific reversal strategies, such as administration of prothrombin complex or recombinant factor VII, may be applied. A large advantage of NOACs in comparison with VKAs is that NOACs have a much shorter half-life. Thus, the duration of the effect is much shorter, thereby decreasing the need for an antidote. Clinical impact of major bleeds, as seen by, for instance, mortality, or the need for hospitalisation or intensive care unit stay, indeed appears to be less with the new oral anticoagulants than with VKAs, despite the fact that an antidote exists for the latter. 55 Specific antidotes are currently under development, such as an antibody against dabigatran 56 and recombinant factor Xa. 57 Severe chronic kidney disease, defined as an eGFR<30 ml/min or <15 ml/min depending on type of NOAC, is a contraindication to NOAC use. There are limited trial data for VKA and NOACs in frail elderly patients. Although NOACs may still be more expensive than VKA, INR monitoring is also expensive. Logistics and available resources may vary between countries or by region and will determine specific cost-effect balances. Cost-effectiveness of AF-related stroke prevention strategies is being explored, and efforts are dedicated to determine the impact of NOACs on health economics. Available evidence suggests that NOACs are cost-effective alternatives to warfarin with regard to efficacy and safety, although the final balance will depend on individual healthcare settings. 58 Comparisons between NOACs are emerging, but are based on indirect comparisons. Because of the shorter half-life of NOACs compared with VKAs, compliance is very important. It is therefore vital for physicians to emphasise the need for daily treatment adherence. An advantage of NOACs may lie in their fixed dose, compared with VKA doses that need to be adjusted based on INR measurements. However, this lack of need for monitoring drug levels reinforces the importance of stressing drug adherence with patients. It should not be underestimated that although the new agents are more convenient, they are still powerful anticoagulants. A dosage box with all medications to dispense may facilitate compliance (although not for dabigatran which requires original packaging). Rivaroxaban needs to be taken with food as taking it on an empty stomach may reduce therapeutic drug levels by up to 40%. Observational studies comparing the actual impact of NOAC use in daily clinical care are now emerging; some show similar and comparable results on the efficacy and safety of NOAC use. From a primary care perspective, such observational studies will help show efficacy and safety of NOAC use in frail elderly patients not included in the large trials. In summary, NOACs are at least as safe as VKA. Barriers for implementation still exist but these may improve with the growing body of trial data on safety and subgroup analyses. Moreover, generalisability may expand as a result of having more registries. In addition, growing confidence in reversal strategies should facilitate implementation.Although there are no specific antidotes yet for NOACs, nonspecific reversal strategies, such as administration of prothrombin complex or recombinant factor VII, may be applied.

In addition, growing confidence in reversal strategies should facilitate implementation.Based on current evidence and experiences, we recommend the following anticoagulation treatment strategy in a primary care setting: Management strategies that should be used All AF patients at high risk of stroke should be offered anticoagulation. In patients with mechanical valves or severe valve disease (defined by a specialist), this anticoagulation should be high-intensity VKA. For patients with AF but without mechanical valves or clinically significant valve disease, both warfarin, to adjusted INR target of 2.5, and NOACs are anticoagulant options. NOACs may represent a more convenient, at least as safe, and at least equally as effective option in the prevention of stroke in AF compared with VKAs. Treatment adherence is an important issue with NOAC use. Thus, on the basis of these issues, as well as cost and access, NOACs and VKAs both represent good treatment options for SPAF. Patients should be fully counselled, including written information, on the risks and benefits of anticoagulation or on changing to or initiating a NOAC. Patient preferences should guide decision-making over whether to initiate anticoagulation, and on what to prescribe, including estimation of a patient’s compliance. The patient groups in whom use of a NOAC is preferable to warfarin are patients who are unable or unwilling to take warfarin, and patients who are difficult to maintain at a stable INR (less than 65% time in therapeutic range). If prescribing NOACs, the importance of treatment adherence must be emphasised. Compliance may be facilitated with the use of a dosage box, except for dabigatran which should only be dispensed in its original packaging (although dabigatran is available in blister packages so, if desired, individual doses can be cut out with their original blister preserved and put in dosage box).

Management strategies that may be used ASA alone has no role in SPAF. In patients at all ages who are unable or unwilling to take VKAs or NOACs, ASA may be used in combination with clopidogrel as antiplatelet therapy to prevent stroke. ASA alone has no role in SPAF.

Additional work recommended in this area/gaps in the evidence See web version. See web version.A large evidence base on the effectiveness of warfarin regimes, the limitations of antiplatelets, and the licensing of several new anticoagulants, has meant that traditional management strategies of SPAF have been challenged in recent years. The practicalities of screening, diagnosis, stroke risk assessment, treatment initiation, monitoring and, where appropriate, cessation of therapy will need to be determined at a local level according to the structure of the healthcare system and expertise of the team. The full web version of this paper provides a list of practical guidance on: Finding the patient with atrial fibrillation; Making the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation; Risk assessment; Preferable anticoagulant; NOAC use with impaired renal function; and initiating and monitoring treatment. The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) has assembled an excellent practical guide on the use of NOACs, to help physicians use NOACs in specific clinical situations. 59 The different clinical scenarios as outlined in the EHRA practical guide, which are useful for both physician and patients to learn how to use these new agents safely and effectively, are summarised in the web version.

AF: atrial fibrillation; OACs: oral anticoagulants; NOACs: novel oral anticoagulants; ASA: acetyl salicylic acid; VKA: vitamin K antagonists.Atrial fibrillation is a common disorder, especially in those aged over 75, and is a major cause of preventable embolic stroke. Anticoagulation therapy, available for 50 years as vitamin K antagonist derivatives like warfarin, can reduce this risk by up to two-thirds, but its use has been complicated by major food and drug interactions, significant bleeding risks, a narrow therapeutic range and the need to monitor. As a consequence, in most countries, only around half of those eligible for anticoagulation are on treatment and many of those treated are poorly controlled. The evidence base for atrial fibrillation stroke risk is considerable and growing, resulting in recent major changes to clinical guidance internationally. This guidance has particular implications for primary care with many new recommendations on better AF diagnosis, more reliable methods of determining stroke risk to guide treatment choice for patients and bleeding risks to manage the risk factors better, and revised treatment options, with the exclusion of low-dose aspirin as an option for most patients, the importance of good therapeutic control if warfarin is used, and the availability of a range of new rapid-onset, short-acting, anticoagulants with few interactions and no monitoring requirements.',\n",

       "  'abstract_text': 'Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter may be managed by either a rhythm control strategy or a rate control strategy but the evidence on the clinical effects of these two intervention strategies is unclear. Our objective was to assess the beneficial and harmful effects of rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Web of Science, BIOSIS, Google Scholar, clinicaltrials.gov, TRIP, EU-CTR, Chi-CTR, and ICTRP for eligible trials comparing any rhythm control strategy with any rate control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter published before November 2016. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, and quality of life. Our secondary outcomes were stroke and ejection fraction. We performed both random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analysis and chose the most conservative result as our primary result. We used Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) to control for random errors. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by visual inspection of forest plots and by calculating inconsistency (I 2 ) for traditional meta-analyses and diversity (D 2 ) for TSA. Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the reasons for substantial statistical heterogeneity. We assessed the risk of publication bias in meta-analyses consisting of 10 trials or more with tests for funnel plot asymmetry. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the body of evidence. 25 randomized clinical trials (n = 9354 participants) were included, all of which were at high risk of bias. Meta-analysis showed that rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies significantly increased the risk of a serious adverse event (risk ratio (RR), 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02 to 1.18; P = 0.02; I 2 = 12% (95% CI 0.00 to 0.32); 21 trials), but TSA did not confirm this result (TSA-adjusted CI 0.99 to 1.22). The increased risk of a serious adverse event did not seem to be caused by any single component of the composite outcome. Meta-analysis showed that rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies were associated with better SF-36 physical component score (mean difference (MD), 6.93 points; 95% CI, 2.25 to 11.61; P = 0.004; I 2 = 95% (95% CI 0.94 to 0.96); 8 trials) and ejection fraction (MD, 4.20%; 95% CI, 0.54 to 7.87; P = 0.02; I 2 = 79% (95% CI 0.69 to 0.85); 7 trials), but TSA did not confirm these results. Both meta-analysis and TSA showed no significant differences on all-cause mortality, SF-36 mental component score, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, and stroke. Rhythm control strategies compared with rate control strategies seem to significantly increase the risk of a serious adverse event in patients with atrial fibrillation. Based on current evidence, it seems that most patients with atrial fibrillation should be treated with a rate control strategy unless there are specific reasons (e.g., patients with unbearable symptoms due to atrial fibrillation or patients who are hemodynamically unstable due to atrial fibrillation) justifying a rhythm control strategy. More randomized trials at low risk of bias and low risk of random errors are needed. PROSPERO CRD42016051433',\n",
       "  'article_text': 'Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia of the heart with a prevalence of approximately 2% in the western world . Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are both associated with an increased risk of morbidity and death . The risks of both cerebral stroke and heart failure are increased nearly fivefold in patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and about 20% of every stroke may be due to atrial fibrillation . Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter also have a significant impact on healthcare costs and account for approximately 1% of the National Health Service budget in the United Kingdom and approximately 26 billion dollars of annual expenses in the United States . Two different overall intervention strategies may be used for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter–a rhythm control strategy and a rate control strategy . When using any rhythm control strategy, the aim is to obtain and maintain sinus rhythm, while the overall aim when using any rate control strategy is to lower the ventricular frequency . No former systematic review assessing the effects of rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies for atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter has searched all relevant databases and has considered both risks of systematic errors and risks of random errors .We conducted this systematic review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines (PRISMA) ( S1 Text ) , and the updated Cochrane methodology used in this systematic review is described in detail in our protocol ( S2 Text ), which was registered prior to the systematic literature search . We searched for trials comparing any rhythm control strategy with any rate control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. We searched for eligible trials published before November 2016 in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded on Web of Science, BIOSIS, Google Scholar, clinicaltrials.gov, Trip Medical Database (TRIP), EU Clinical Trial Register (EU-CTR), Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR), and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) . The search strategy can be found in the supplementary material ( S3 Text ). Additionally, we checked the reference lists of relevant publications for any unidentified trials. Trials were included irrespective of trial design, setting, publication status, publication year, language, and the reporting of one of our outcomes. Three authors (NJS, JF, EEN) independently selected relevant trials, and four authors (NJS, SS, JF, EEN) extracted data using a standardized data extraction sheet and assessed the risk of bias according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and Lundh et al. . Any discrepancies were discussed with a fifth review author (JCJ). We attempted to contact trial authors if relevant data were unclear or missing. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events (as defined by the ICH guidelines) , and quality of life. Our secondary outcomes were stroke and ejection fraction. All outcomes were analyzed as proportions of participants in each intervention group except for quality of life and ejection fraction which were both analyzed as continuous outcomes. For all outcomes, we used the trial results reported at maximal follow-up. However, if the trialists reported results at multiple time-points, we used the results reported at the time-point closest to 24 months. We planned the following subgroup analyses on our primary outcomes: comparison of different types of rhythm control interventions; comparison of different types of rate control interventions; comparison of different mean ages of participants; comparison of different durations of atrial fibrillation; comparison of different durations of anticoagulation therapy; comparison of participants with atrial fibrillation to participants with atrial flutter; and comparison of trials only randomizing men to trials only randomizing women. Additionally, we performed a post-hoc subgroup analysis: comparison of participants with heart failure to participants without heart failure. We performed our meta-analyses according to the recommendations stated in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions , Keus et al. , and the eight-step assessment suggested by Jakobsen et al. for better validation of meta-analytic results in systematic reviews. Review Manager 5 and Stata 15 were used for all meta-analyses . We used risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. We did not use standardized mean difference (SMD) when analyzing continuous outcomes due to the fact that the outcomes assessed were not homogeneous and the several methodological limitations of using this approach . We performed both random-effects (DerSimonian-Laird model) and fixed-effect meta-analysis with the Mantel-Haenszel method and chose the most conservative result as our primary result . The more conservative result was the result with the highest P value and the widest 95% confidence interval (CI). If there was substantial discrepancy between the results of the two methods, we reported and discussed the results . We used Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) to control for random errors and reported TSA-adjusted CI if the cumulative Z-curves did not reach the futility area or passed the diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) . TSA estimates the DARIS (that is the number of participants needed in a meta-analysis to detect or reject a certain intervention effect). When analyzing dichotomous outcomes, we pragmatically anticipated an intervention effect of 15% risk ratio reduction (RRR). When analyzing continuous outcomes, we pragmatically anticipated an intervention effect equal to the MD of the observed SD/2 . Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by visual inspection of forest plots and by calculating inconsistency (I 2 ) for traditional meta-analyses and diversity (D 2 ) for TSA . We calculated the 95% CI of the inconsistency (I 2 ) with the TSA software . Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the reasons for substantial statistical heterogeneity . We assessed the risk of publication bias in meta-analyses consisting of 10 trials or more with tests for funnel plot asymmetry. We assessed three primary outcomes and, hence, considered a P value of 0.025 or less as the threshold for statistical significance for the primary outcomes . We assessed two secondary outcomes and, hence, considered a P value of 0.033 as the threshold for statistical significance for the secondary outcomes . We used ‘best-worst case’ analyses and ‘worst-best case’ analyses to assess the potential impact of missing data (incomplete outcome data bias) . We calculated Bayes factor to show if the meta-analysis results fitted better with the null hypotheses or the anticipated intervention effects . We used GRADE to assess the quality of the body of evidence .We searched for trials comparing any rhythm control strategy with any rate control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.

All outcomes were analyzed as proportions of participants in each intervention group except for quality of life and ejection fraction which were both analyzed as continuous outcomes. For all outcomes, we used the trial results reported at maximal follow-up. However, if the trialists reported results at multiple time-points, we used the results reported at the time-point closest to 24 months. We planned the following subgroup analyses on our primary outcomes: comparison of different types of rhythm control interventions; comparison of different types of rate control interventions; comparison of different mean ages of participants; comparison of different durations of atrial fibrillation; comparison of different durations of anticoagulation therapy; comparison of participants with atrial fibrillation to participants with atrial flutter; and comparison of trials only randomizing men to trials only randomizing women. Additionally, we performed a post-hoc subgroup analysis: comparison of participants with heart failure to participants without heart failure.We performed our meta-analyses according to the recommendations stated in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions , Keus et al. , and the eight-step assessment suggested by Jakobsen et al. for better validation of meta-analytic results in systematic reviews. Review Manager 5 and Stata 15 were used for all meta-analyses . We used risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. We did not use standardized mean difference (SMD) when analyzing continuous outcomes due to the fact that the outcomes assessed were not homogeneous and the several methodological limitations of using this approach . We performed both random-effects (DerSimonian-Laird model) and fixed-effect meta-analysis with the Mantel-Haenszel method and chose the most conservative result as our primary result . The more conservative result was the result with the highest P value and the widest 95% confidence interval (CI). If there was substantial discrepancy between the results of the two methods, we reported and discussed the results . We used Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) to control for random errors and reported TSA-adjusted CI if the cumulative Z-curves did not reach the futility area or passed the diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) . TSA estimates the DARIS (that is the number of participants needed in a meta-analysis to detect or reject a certain intervention effect). When analyzing dichotomous outcomes, we pragmatically anticipated an intervention effect of 15% risk ratio reduction (RRR). When analyzing continuous outcomes, we pragmatically anticipated an intervention effect equal to the MD of the observed SD/2 . Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by visual inspection of forest plots and by calculating inconsistency (I 2 ) for traditional meta-analyses and diversity (D 2 ) for TSA . We calculated the 95% CI of the inconsistency (I 2 ) with the TSA software . Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the reasons for substantial statistical heterogeneity . We assessed the risk of publication bias in meta-analyses consisting of 10 trials or more with tests for funnel plot asymmetry. We assessed three primary outcomes and, hence, considered a P value of 0.025 or less as the threshold for statistical significance for the primary outcomes . We assessed two secondary outcomes and, hence, considered a P value of 0.033 as the threshold for statistical significance for the secondary outcomes . We used ‘best-worst case’ analyses and ‘worst-best case’ analyses to assess the potential impact of missing data (incomplete outcome data bias) . We calculated Bayes factor to show if the meta-analysis results fitted better with the null hypotheses or the anticipated intervention effects . We used GRADE to assess the quality of the body of evidence .Our literature search identified a total of 16 952 papers. We included 25 randomized clinical trials with 26 trial comparisons including a total of 9354 participants ( Fig 1 ) . All trials were at high risk of bias ( S1 Table ). All trials included participants with atrial fibrillation and three trials included both participants with atrial fibrillation and flutter . The individual trials used various types of rhythm control interventions and rate control interventions. The rhythm control interventions used were: amiodarone with or without electrical cardioversion (6/26 trial comparisons); not specified (6/26 trial comparisons); electrical cardioversion with antiarrhythmic drug therapy following sinus rhythm restoration (5/26 trial comparisons); catheter ablation (4/26 trial comparisons); antiarrhythmic therapy with or without electrical cardioversion (2/26 trial comparisons); ibutilide (1/26 trial comparisons); propafenone (1/26 trial comparisons); and total endoscopic ablation (1/26 trial comparisons). The rate control interventions used were: beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, or a combination of these (11/26 trial comparisons); not specified (5/26 trial comparisons); AV-node ablation (4/26 trial comparisons); digoxin and/or beta blockers (2/26 trial comparisons); diltiazem (2/26 trial comparisons); beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, and/or AV-node ablation (1/26 trial comparisons); and digoxin, carvedilol, and/or bisoprolol (1/26 trial comparisons). We have summarized the inclusion- and exclusion criteria for each included trial in S2 Table and other trial characteristics in S3 Table . Additionally, we have summarized the characteristics of excluded studies and characteristics of ongoing trials in S3 Table . We screened 16 952 records and included 56 publications of 25 trials in this systematic review. 18 trials randomizing a total of 8668 participants reported all-cause mortality. Meta-analysis showed no significant difference between rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.16; P = .35; I 2 = 0% (95% CI 0 to 33%); Bayes factor = 3438; Fig 2 ). Visual inspection of the forest plot showed no signs of heterogeneity ( Fig 2 ). The TSA showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject a RRR of 15% (TSA-adjusted CI 0.90 to 1.22) ( Fig 3 ). Incomplete outcome data bias alone had the potential to influence the results in the ‘worst-best case’-scenario ( S1 and S2 Figs). Visual inspection of the funnel plot showed no clear signs of asymmetry ( S3 Fig ). Meta-analysis showed no significant difference between rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies when assessing all-cause mortality. Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject a risk ratio reduction of 15% (TSA-adjusted confidence interval 0.90 to 1.22). The Z-curve (the blue line) does not cross any boundaries. 21 trials randomizing a total of 8789 participants reported the proportion of participants with a serious adverse event. Meta-analysis showed that rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies significantly increased the risk of a serious adverse event (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.18; P = 0.02; I 2 = 12% (95% CI 0 to 32%); Bayes factor = 1.05 e9 ; Fig 4 ). Visual inspection of the forest plot did not show signs of heterogeneity ( Fig 4 ). The TSA showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject a RRR of 15% (TSA-adjusted CI 0.99 to 1.22) ( Fig 5 ). Incomplete outcome data bias alone had the potential to influence the results in the ‘best-worst case’-scenario ( S4 and S5 Figs). Visual inspection of the funnel plot showed a bit asymmetry ( S6 Fig ), but Harbord’s test showed no significance (P = 0.63). Meta-analysis showed that rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies significantly increased the risk of a serious adverse event. Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) of serious adverse events showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject a RRR of 15% (TSA-adjusted confidence interval 0.99 to 1.22). The Z-curve (the blue line) does not cross any boundaries. We have summarized the specific types of serious adverse events in each trial in S4 Table . We did not include hospitalization for non-acute electrical cardioversion or hospitalization for elective antiarrhythmic drug loading as a serious adverse event, as readmission for non-acute electrical cardioversion and readmission for elective antiarrhythmic drug loading in most trials was mandated by the individual trial protocols (see ‘ Discussion ‘). The four primary components of the composite outcome serious adverse event (excluding all-cause mortality and stroke) were myocardial infarction, heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, and hospitalization (excluding hospitalization for non-acute electrical cardioversion and hospitalization for elective antiarrhythmic drug loading). Meta-analysis of either myocardial infarction, heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, or hospitalization (excluding hospitalization for non-acute electrical cardioversion and hospitalization for elective antiarrhythmic drug loading) showed no significant difference between rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies ( S7 – S10 Figs). All the planned tests for subgroup differences when analyzing both all-cause mortality ( S11 – S15 Figs) and serious adverse events ( S16 – S20 Figs) showed no significant differences. Two of the planned subgroup analyses (comparison of participants with atrial fibrillation to those with atrial flutter; and comparison of trials only randomizing men to trials only randomizing women) were not possible to conduct due to lack of relevant data. The post hoc subgroup analysis (comparison of participants with heart failure to participants without heart failure) also showed no significant differences when analyzing all-cause mortality ( S21 Fig ) and serious adverse events ( S22 Fig ). Quality of life was only assessed in 13 out of 24 trials and different assessment scales were used, including SF-36, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, Psychological General Well-Being Index, and Mental Health Inventory. All trials reported standard deviations for their analyses. Hence, we did not need to impute standard deviations. Only data from SF-36 physical component score, SF-36 mental component score, and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire could be used in meta-analyses. The only meta-analysis showing a statistically significant result was the analysis of the results of SF-36 physical component score (MD, 6.93 points in favor of the rhythm control group; 95% CI, 2.25 to 11.61; P = 0.004; I 2 = 95% (95% CI 94 to 96%); Bayes factor = 0.022; Fig 6 ). However, both visual inspection of the forest plot ( Fig 6 ) and the statistical tests showed considerable heterogeneity (I 2 = 95% (95% CI 94 to 96%)), and the TSA showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject a MD of 4.81 points (TSA-adjusted CI -3.16 to 17.02) ( Fig 7 ). Furthermore, incomplete outcome data bias alone had the potential to influence the results ( S23 and S24 Figs). The remaining meta-analyses (analysis of SF-36 mental component score and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire) showed no significant differences ( S25 and S26 Figs), and the TSAs showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject our anticipated intervention effects ( S27 Fig ). We have summarized all these results in Table 1 . Meta-analysis showed that rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies significantly increased the quality of life measured by SF-36 PCS. Trial Sequential Analysis showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject a mean difference of 4.81 points (TSA-adjusted confidence interval -3.16 to 17.02). The Z-curve (the blue line) does not cross any boundaries. 13 trials randomizing a total of 8114 participants reported the proportion of participants with stroke. Meta-analysis showed no significant difference between rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.38; P = .78; I 2 = 9% (95% CI 0 to 44%); Fig 8 ). Visual inspection of the forest plot did not show signs of heterogeneity ( Fig 8 ). The TSA showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject a RRR of 15% (TSA-adjusted CI 0.33 to 3.28) ( Fig 9 ). Incomplete outcome data bias alone did not have the potential to influence the results ( S28 and S29 Figs). Meta-analysis showed no significant difference between rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies when assessing stroke. Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject a risk ratio reduction of 15% (TSA-adjusted confidence interval 0.33 to 3.28). The Z-curve (the blue line) does not cross any boundaries. Seven trials randomizing a total of 428 participants assessed the effects of rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies on ejection fraction. Meta-analysis showed that rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies significantly increased the mean ejection fraction (MD, 4.20%; 95% CI, 0.54 to 7.87; P = 0.02; I 2 = 79% (95% CI 69 to 85%); Fig 10 ). Visual inspection of the forest plot showed some signs of heterogeneity ( Fig 10 ). The TSA showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject a MD of 4.20% (TSA-adjusted CI -2.37 to 10.77) ( Fig 11 ). Incomplete outcome data bias alone had the potential to influence the results in the ‘worst-best case’ scenario ( S30 and S31 Figs). Meta-analysis showed that rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies significantly increased the ejection fraction. Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject a mean difference of 4.20% (TSA-adjusted confidence interval -2.37 to 10.77).

We have summarized our main results in the Summary of Findings table ( Table 2 ).We included 25 trials randomizing a total of 9354 participants with 26 comparisons of rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies. All trials and outcome results were at high risk of bias and the quality of the evidence according to GRADE was ‘very low’ (see Summary of Findings table ( Table 2 )). The meta-analysis of serious adverse events showed that rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies significantly increased the risk of serious adverse events by approximately 10%, but TSA did not confirm this result. The increased risk of a serious adverse event did not seem to be driven by a particular component of the composite outcome. The meta-analyses of quality of life (SF-36 physical component score) and ejection fraction both showed a statistically significant effect in favor of the rhythm control group. However, TSAs showed that we did not have enough information to confirm or reject our anticipated intervention effects and the clinical relevance of an increase of 6.93 points on SF-36 physical component score and an increase of 4.20% in ejection fraction is questionable. No significant differences between rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies were found when assessing all-cause mortality, quality of life assessed by SF-36 mental component score, quality of life assessed by Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, or stroke–and all corresponding TSAs showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject our anticipated intervention effects. Our review has several strengths. We included more participants than any previous review which gives us increased power and precision to detect any significant difference between our compared treatment strategies . We followed our protocol which was registered prior to the systematic literature search . Data were double-extracted by independent authors minimizing the risk of inaccurate data-extraction, and we assessed the risk of bias in all trials according to Cochrane . We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence , TSA to assess the risks of random errors , the eight-step assessment suggested by Jakobsen et al. to assess if the thresholds for significance were crossed , and sensitivity analyses (best-worst and worst-best) to test the potential impact of incomplete outcome data bias. Hence, this systematic review considered both risks of random errors and risks of systematic errors which adds further robustness to our results and conclusions. Another strength of our review is that we pragmatically accepted any rhythm control strategy and any rate control strategy–our results may therefore guide a clinician when choosing between the treatment strategies. The main result of this review is the apparent increased risk of a serious adverse event when using rhythm control strategies and the statistical heterogeneity of this meta-analysis result was low (I 2 = 12% (95% CI 0 to 32%)). Hence, the included trials seem to show very similar results which increase the validity of the meta-analysis result. As mentioned in the results section, we did not plan to include hospitalization for non-acute electrical cardioversion or hospitalization for elective antiarrhythmic drug loading as a serious adverse event, but it might be argued that any hospitalization ought to be considered a serious adverse event . If we had included hospitalization for non-acute electrical cardioversion and hospitalization for elective antiarrhythmic drug loading, which in multiple trials were mandated by their protocol, the increased risk of a serious adverse event in the rhythm control group would be even greater. A post hoc meta-analysis confirmed this assumption ( S32 Fig ). Our results after excluding hospitalization for non-acute electrical cardioversion and hospitalization for elective antiarrhythmic drug loading as a serious adverse event were still significant which also increase the validity of our results. Our review also has several limitations. All trials were at high risk of bias and especially the risk of incomplete blinding of participants and personnel and for-profit bias might bias our review results. Our assessment of especially publication bias was also uncertain, as a relatively low number of trials were included. Furthermore, some of the performed meta-analyses had considerable statistical heterogeneity. Hence, publication bias and heterogeneity might further bias our results. Large meta-epidemiological studies have shown that high risks of bias tend to overestimate benefits and underestimate harms of experimental interventions . We hypothesized that the rhythm control strategy in most trials may be regarded as the experimental group and that the risk of a serious adverse event when using rhythm control strategies might be even higher than our results show due to the risk of bias. When assessing the overall quality of the available evidence, GRADE assessment showed that the quality of the evidence was ‘very low’ for all outcomes, mostly due to risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency (see Summary of Findings table ( Table 2 )). Another limitation of our present review is the use of a composite outcome such as serious adverse events. A potential limitation when using composite outcomes is that each component of a composite outcome (in this case serious adverse events) will not necessarily have similar degrees of severity and will not be affected similarly by the interventions . ‘True’ differences in severity between compared groups might therefore not be reflected in review results when using composite outcomes . Several of the included trials did not specify the type of serious adverse events but it was, e.g., often just reported that a given patient was hospitalized ( S4 Table ). Hence, it was difficult to assess severity differences between the compared groups when assessing risks of serious adverse events. We believe that the clinical relevance of the outcome ‘serious adverse events’ and the resulting increased statistical power when using serious adverse events as an outcome justifies the use of serious adverse events as a primary outcome, but the interpretative limitations ought to be considered. A further limitation of our review is that we considered rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies as two goal oriented intervention strategies. Due to widely varying interventions within the two groups, we were not able to assess the effects of each single intervention. However, even though the specific treatment elements of both rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies differed across trials ( S3 Table ), our results on both all-cause mortality and serious adverse events showed very limited statistical heterogeneity and test for subgroup differences showed no significant differences. Furthermore, our results show an averaged effect and if certain specific treatment elements have beneficial effects that differ from our overall meta-analysis results then other treatment elements must have more harmful effects. Nevertheless, it might be that certain single treatment elements have effects that are not shown by our analyses. The results on quality of life and ejection fraction had very large degrees of statistical heterogeneity and were especially at high risk of selective outcome reporting bias. Accordingly, these results should be interpreted with great caution. The higher risk of a serious adverse event in the rhythm control group might be caused by incorrect use of anticoagulation therapy in the rhythm control group, i.e., physicians might avoid prescribing appropriate anticoagulation therapy if the patient has obtained sinus rhythm. We performed several subgroup analyses comparing trials with different recommendations for anticoagulation therapy (anticoagulation therapy until sinus rhythm for at least 4 weeks compared to anticoagulation therapy until sinus rhythm for at least 12 weeks compared to anticoagulation therapy until end of follow-up) ( S20 Fig ). No subgroup differences were found. Additionally, we found no difference between rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies when assessing stroke and the point estimate was very close to 1.00 (1.04) ( Fig 8 ). If the participants in the rhythm control group had received insufficient anticoagulation therapy, we would have expected a higher risk of stroke in the rhythm control group. We have identified multiple systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter . The most recent review, made by Al-Khatib et al., was published in 2014 . They included 16 trials randomizing 7608 participants and showed comparable efficacy of rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies . The other previous reviews showed similar findings , except Testa et al. who showed that rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies significantly increased the risk of the combined outcome of all-cause mortality and stroke by OR at 1.15 . However, their meta-analysis only included five trials randomizing 5239 participants . We did not plan to assess this composite outcome but a post hoc meta-analysis assessing this composite outcome did not show any significant difference between rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies ( S33 Fig ). Our present review is the first systematic review of randomized clinical trials showing that rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies significantly increases the risk of a serious adverse event. Furthermore, no clinically significant beneficial effect of rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies was found. We have also identified multiple observational studies assessing the effects of rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter , but these studies showed conflicting results. Comparable to our findings, Noheria et al. included 6988 participants and showed comparable efficacy of rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies when assessing all-cause mortality, heart failure, and stroke, but rhythm control strategies significantly increased the risk of cardiovascular hospitalizations . Contrary to our findings, Ionescu-Ittu et al. included 26 130 participants and showed comparable efficacy of the strategies when assessing all-cause mortality within four years of treatment onset, but five and eight years after treatment onset rate control strategies significantly increased the risk of dying . Furthermore, Camm et al. included 5604 participants and showed that rhythm control strategies were superior to rate control strategies . A fourth study, Purmah et al., showed comparable efficacy of the strategies when assessing all-cause mortality . The different results between these observational studies might be caused by, e.g., different inclusion- and exclusion criteria, baseline confounding factors, and confounding by unmeasured variables . Accordingly, observational studies may or may not support our findings. Current guidelines and recent narrative reviews recommend that a rate control strategy should be used in most patients, while a rhythm control strategy is indicated only to improve symptoms in patients who remain symptomatic on adequate rate control therapy . Our results confirm this recommendation and further indicate that rhythm control strategies seem to be more harmful than rate control strategies without any meaningful beneficial effect of rhythm control strategies. Nevertheless, January et al. reports that a rhythm control strategy might be favored in specific patient subgroups. We performed several relevant subgroup analyses and found no significant differences. Moreover, no randomized clinical trial has investigated the effect of rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies in young patients, and the other subgroup analyses had limited data. Hence, we were not able to investigate if specific patient subgroups differed compared to our main results. We identified eight ongoing trials (see S3 Table ) that might contribute to the current evidence on rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies for atrial fibrillation . These ongoing trials will contribute to the evidence on all-cause mortality, hospitalization, stroke, quality of life, and ejection fraction. Furthermore, AFARC-LVF (NCT02509754), EAST-AFNET 4 , and RAFT-AF will focus on the effect of catheter ablation as a rhythm control strategy. These three trials will provide evidence on whether or not catheter ablation is superior to rate control. All ongoing and future trials should be conducted with low risk of systematic error and low risk of random errors, and ought to be designed and reported according to the SPIRIT and CONSORT guidelines .The meta-analysis of serious adverse events showed that rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies significantly increased the risk of serious adverse events by approximately 10%, but TSA did not confirm this result. The increased risk of a serious adverse event did not seem to be driven by a particular component of the composite outcome. The meta-analyses of quality of life (SF-36 physical component score) and ejection fraction both showed a statistically significant effect in favor of the rhythm control group. However, TSAs showed that we did not have enough information to confirm or reject our anticipated intervention effects and the clinical relevance of an increase of 6.93 points on SF-36 physical component score and an increase of 4.20% in ejection fraction is questionable. No significant differences between rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies were found when assessing all-cause mortality, quality of life assessed by SF-36 mental component score, quality of life assessed by Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, or stroke–and all corresponding TSAs showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject our anticipated intervention effects.Our review has several strengths. We included more participants than any previous review which gives us increased power and precision to detect any significant difference between our compared treatment strategies . We followed our protocol which was registered prior to the systematic literature search . Data were double-extracted by independent authors minimizing the risk of inaccurate data-extraction, and we assessed the risk of bias in all trials according to Cochrane . We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence , TSA to assess the risks of random errors , the eight-step assessment suggested by Jakobsen et al. to assess if the thresholds for significance were crossed , and sensitivity analyses (best-worst and worst-best) to test the potential impact of incomplete outcome data bias. Hence, this systematic review considered both risks of random errors and risks of systematic errors which adds further robustness to our results and conclusions. Another strength of our review is that we pragmatically accepted any rhythm control strategy and any rate control strategy–our results may therefore guide a clinician when choosing between the treatment strategies. The main result of this review is the apparent increased risk of a serious adverse event when using rhythm control strategies and the statistical heterogeneity of this meta-analysis result was low (I 2 = 12% (95% CI 0 to 32%)). Hence, the included trials seem to show very similar results which increase the validity of the meta-analysis result. As mentioned in the results section, we did not plan to include hospitalization for non-acute electrical cardioversion or hospitalization for elective antiarrhythmic drug loading as a serious adverse event, but it might be argued that any hospitalization ought to be considered a serious adverse event . If we had included hospitalization for non-acute electrical cardioversion and hospitalization for elective antiarrhythmic drug loading, which in multiple trials were mandated by their protocol, the increased risk of a serious adverse event in the rhythm control group would be even greater. A post hoc meta-analysis confirmed this assumption ( S32 Fig ). Our results after excluding hospitalization for non-acute electrical cardioversion and hospitalization for elective antiarrhythmic drug loading as a serious adverse event were still significant which also increase the validity of our results. Our review also has several limitations. All trials were at high risk of bias and especially the risk of incomplete blinding of participants and personnel and for-profit bias might bias our review results. Our assessment of especially publication bias was also uncertain, as a relatively low number of trials were included. Furthermore, some of the performed meta-analyses had considerable statistical heterogeneity. Hence, publication bias and heterogeneity might further bias our results. Large meta-epidemiological studies have shown that high risks of bias tend to overestimate benefits and underestimate harms of experimental interventions . We hypothesized that the rhythm control strategy in most trials may be regarded as the experimental group and that the risk of a serious adverse event when using rhythm control strategies might be even higher than our results show due to the risk of bias. When assessing the overall quality of the available evidence, GRADE assessment showed that the quality of the evidence was ‘very low’ for all outcomes, mostly due to risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency (see Summary of Findings table ( Table 2 )). Another limitation of our present review is the use of a composite outcome such as serious adverse events. A potential limitation when using composite outcomes is that each component of a composite outcome (in this case serious adverse events) will not necessarily have similar degrees of severity and will not be affected similarly by the interventions . ‘True’ differences in severity between compared groups might therefore not be reflected in review results when using composite outcomes . Several of the included trials did not specify the type of serious adverse events but it was, e.g., often just reported that a given patient was hospitalized ( S4 Table ). Hence, it was difficult to assess severity differences between the compared groups when assessing risks of serious adverse events. We believe that the clinical relevance of the outcome ‘serious adverse events’ and the resulting increased statistical power when using serious adverse events as an outcome justifies the use of serious adverse events as a primary outcome, but the interpretative limitations ought to be considered. A further limitation of our review is that we considered rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies as two goal oriented intervention strategies. Due to widely varying interventions within the two groups, we were not able to assess the effects of each single intervention. However, even though the specific treatment elements of both rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies differed across trials ( S3 Table ), our results on both all-cause mortality and serious adverse events showed very limited statistical heterogeneity and test for subgroup differences showed no significant differences. Furthermore, our results show an averaged effect and if certain specific treatment elements have beneficial effects that differ from our overall meta-analysis results then other treatment elements must have more harmful effects. Nevertheless, it might be that certain single treatment elements have effects that are not shown by our analyses. The results on quality of life and ejection fraction had very large degrees of statistical heterogeneity and were especially at high risk of selective outcome reporting bias. Accordingly, these results should be interpreted with great caution. The higher risk of a serious adverse event in the rhythm control group might be caused by incorrect use of anticoagulation therapy in the rhythm control group, i.e., physicians might avoid prescribing appropriate anticoagulation therapy if the patient has obtained sinus rhythm. We performed several subgroup analyses comparing trials with different recommendations for anticoagulation therapy (anticoagulation therapy until sinus rhythm for at least 4 weeks compared to anticoagulation therapy until sinus rhythm for at least 12 weeks compared to anticoagulation therapy until end of follow-up) ( S20 Fig ). No subgroup differences were found. Additionally, we found no difference between rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies when assessing stroke and the point estimate was very close to 1.00 (1.04) ( Fig 8 ). If the participants in the rhythm control group had received insufficient anticoagulation therapy, we would have expected a higher risk of stroke in the rhythm control group.We have identified multiple systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter . The most recent review, made by Al-Khatib et al., was published in 2014 . They included 16 trials randomizing 7608 participants and showed comparable efficacy of rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies . The other previous reviews showed similar findings , except Testa et al. who showed that rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies significantly increased the risk of the combined outcome of all-cause mortality and stroke by OR at 1.15 . However, their meta-analysis only included five trials randomizing 5239 participants . We did not plan to assess this composite outcome but a post hoc meta-analysis assessing this composite outcome did not show any significant difference between rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies ( S33 Fig ). Our present review is the first systematic review of randomized clinical trials showing that rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies significantly increases the risk of a serious adverse event. Furthermore, no clinically significant beneficial effect of rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies was found. We have also identified multiple observational studies assessing the effects of rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter , but these studies showed conflicting results. Comparable to our findings, Noheria et al. included 6988 participants and showed comparable efficacy of rhythm control strategies and rate control strategies when assessing all-cause mortality, heart failure, and stroke, but rhythm control strategies significantly increased the risk of cardiovascular hospitalizations . Contrary to our findings, Ionescu-Ittu et al. included 26 130 participants and showed comparable efficacy of the strategies when assessing all-cause mortality within four years of treatment onset, but five and eight years after treatment onset rate control strategies significantly increased the risk of dying . Furthermore, Camm et al. included 5604 participants and showed that rhythm control strategies were superior to rate control strategies . A fourth study, Purmah et al., showed comparable efficacy of the strategies when assessing all-cause mortality . The different results between these observational studies might be caused by, e.g., different inclusion- and exclusion criteria, baseline confounding factors, and confounding by unmeasured variables . Accordingly, observational studies may or may not support our findings.Current guidelines and recent narrative reviews recommend that a rate control strategy should be used in most patients, while a rhythm control strategy is indicated only to improve symptoms in patients who remain symptomatic on adequate rate control therapy . Our results confirm this recommendation and further indicate that rhythm control strategies seem to be more harmful than rate control strategies without any meaningful beneficial effect of rhythm control strategies. Nevertheless, January et al. reports that a rhythm control strategy might be favored in specific patient subgroups. We performed several relevant subgroup analyses and found no significant differences. Moreover, no randomized clinical trial has investigated the effect of rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies in young patients, and the other subgroup analyses had limited data. Hence, we were not able to investigate if specific patient subgroups differed compared to our main results.We identified eight ongoing trials (see S3 Table ) that might contribute to the current evidence on rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies for atrial fibrillation . These ongoing trials will contribute to the evidence on all-cause mortality, hospitalization, stroke, quality of life, and ejection fraction. Furthermore, AFARC-LVF (NCT02509754), EAST-AFNET 4 , and RAFT-AF will focus on the effect of catheter ablation as a rhythm control strategy. These three trials will provide evidence on whether or not catheter ablation is superior to rate control. All ongoing and future trials should be conducted with low risk of systematic error and low risk of random errors, and ought to be designed and reported according to the SPIRIT and CONSORT guidelines .There might be specific reasons why certain patients with atrial fibrillation ought to be offered a rhythm control strategy aiming at obtaining and maintaining sinus rhythm (e.g., patients with unbearable symptoms due to atrial fibrillation, patients who are hemodynamically unstable due to atrial fibrillation, or patients who are symptomatic even after adequate rate control). Nevertheless, a rhythm control strategy often includes multiple interventions (e.g., antiarrhythmic therapy, electrical cardioversion, etc.) and our results show that rhythm control strategies seem to offer more harm than benefit in patients with atrial fibrillation. We conclude that more randomized clinical trials with low risk of bias and low risk of play of chance are needed, but based on current evidence, it seems that most patients with atrial fibrillation should be treated with a rate control strategy unless there are specific reasons justifying a rhythm control strategy.We changed our subgroup “age of participants: 0 to 59 years, 60–79 years, and above 80 years” to “mean age of the participants: 0 to 59 years, 60–79 years, and above 80 years”, as the former was not possible to conduct due to lack of data.(DOCX) Click here for additional data file.

       "  'article_text': 'Hyperthyroidism, or thyrotoxicosis occurs due to excess release of thyroid hormone due to an overactive thyroid gland or passive release of the stored hormone. Additionally, hyperthyroidism occurs from over treatment with thyroid hormone. Hyperthyroidism is generally considered overt or subclinical, depending on the biochemical severity of the hyperthyroidism. Overt hyperthyroidism is defined as suppressed (usually undetectable) thyrotropin (TSH) and elevated levels of triiodothyronine (T3) and/or estimated free thyroxine (free T4). Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a low or undetectable serum TSH with values within the normal reference range for both T3 and free T4. 1 Hyperthyroidism should be considered the potential illness whenever TSH level is subnormal. The prevalence of hyperthyroidism in the United States is approximately 1.2% (0.5% overt and 0.7% subclinical). 2 In an older community in Baltimore, the prevalence of low TSH was 9.6% for participants on thyroid hormone and 0.8% for untreated individuals. 3 In a study performed by Krahn et al., the authors found that <1% of cases of atrial fibrillation are secondary to an acute hyperthyroid state. 4 Despite hyperthyroidism being a relatively rare cause of atrial fibrillation, this review underscores the importance of identifying thyrotoxic atrial fibrillation, understanding differences in pathophysiology and management as well as illustrating the importance of screening for hyperthyroidism in those presenting with atrial fibrillation. We have compiled literature from PubMed, Scopus and Ovid to ensure a thorough and accurate literature review.Hyperthyroidism is a well-known cause of atrial fibrillation. In a large population based study by frost and colleagues, all patients with new onset hyperthyroidism in the inpatient setting were followed ±30 days from the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism to observe for a new onset diagnosis of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. It was found that 8.3% of such patients had a new onset diagnosis of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. 2 In patients with hyperthyroidism it was found that those who were male, advancing age, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and valvular heart disease were found to have a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation. 5 In a large nationwide cohort study performed in Denmark by Selmer and colleagues, patients who were diagnosed with new onset atrial fibrillation were followed in the outpatient setting for 13 years to identify if they would develop hyperthyroidism. 6 In the 13 year follow up there was a significantly higher incidence of hyperthyroidism being diagnosed particularly in the male population between the ages of 51–60 when compared to the general population of that age without a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. Another Canadian study was performed testing this association on a smaller scale and failed to show an association. 7 However, as the study performed by Selmer and colleagues was the most comprehensive study, its clinical application includes routine screening for hyperthyroidism in patients with new onset atrial fibrillation. While there are no studies on the incidence of subclinical hyperthyroidism after presenting with atrial fibrillation, routine monitoring of thyroid studies would identify this subgroup. The authors believed that these findings may have been secondary to: 1 Autoantibody formation against β1-adrenergic and M2-muscarinic receptors has been known to occur in hyperthyroidism and may trigger Atrial fibrillation prior to thyroid dysfunction. 8 2 A genetic susceptibility to atrial fibrillation may be linked to hyperthyroidism 9 3 Patients may have relative rises or falls in thyroid function testing, yet still remain within normal limits compared to reference values. Such variation may increase the risk of developing atrial fibrillation and will subsequently increase the risk of clinical hyperthyroidism in the future 10 , 11 Autoantibody formation against β1-adrenergic and M2-muscarinic receptors has been known to occur in hyperthyroidism and may trigger Atrial fibrillation prior to thyroid dysfunction. 8 A genetic susceptibility to atrial fibrillation may be linked to hyperthyroidism 9 Patients may have relative rises or falls in thyroid function testing, yet still remain within normal limits compared to reference values. Such variation may increase the risk of developing atrial fibrillation and will subsequently increase the risk of clinical hyperthyroidism in the future 10 , 11 Current guidelines are not available regarding frequency of screening and are per clinician discretion.In a large nationwide cohort study performed in Denmark by Selmer and colleagues, patients who were diagnosed with new onset atrial fibrillation were followed in the outpatient setting for 13 years to identify if they would develop hyperthyroidism. 6 In the 13 year follow up there was a significantly higher incidence of hyperthyroidism being diagnosed particularly in the male population between the ages of 51–60 when compared to the general population of that age without a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.

If the patient has a long wavelength as per this theory then re-entry will not be maintained and thus self terminate. 13 In order for atrial fibrillation to be sustained the wavelength has to be short enough such that wavefronts can circulate the atrium without termination. As per this theory, atrial refractoriness, conduction velocity or both has to be sufficiently reduced to allow re-entry of wavefronts and sustainment of atrial fibrillatory waves. Other theories exist regarding the mechanism of atrial fibrillation including the presence of anatomical substrate and abnormal ectopic atrial firing. Because anyone of these abnormal findings can result in atrial fibrillation, it is important to note differences in pathophysiology between those who have atrial fibrillation with hyperthyroid and euthyroid functions. In those patients who were hyperthyroid it was found that elevated thyroid hormone altered the β1-adrenergic and M2-muscarinic receptors of the heart resulting in increased sympathetic function, tachycardia and decreased atrial refractory period. It is also known that thyroid hormone plays a role in altering ionic channels. In a study performed by Watanbe et al. the effects of thyroid hormone on mRNA expression and currents of major ionic channels were studied in murine atria. The authors found that thyroid hormone resulted in such major changes 14 : 1.) Decreased L-type Calcium channel mRNA expression 2.) Increased expression of Kv 1.5 mRNA 3.) The above changes resulted in increased outward current and decreased inward current resulting in shorter action potential duration Decreased L-type Calcium channel mRNA expression Increased expression of Kv 1.5 mRNA The above changes resulted in increased outward current and decreased inward current resulting in shorter action potential duration In another study performed in rats, the authors compared action potential duration and whole cell currents in the right and left atria in both euthyroid and hyperthyroid mice. The authors found more significant shortening of APD and greater delayed rectifier potassium current increases in the right atrium than the left atrium in hyperthyroid rats which can further increase the risk for atrial arrhythmias. 15 A separate study performed by Chen et al. studied the effects of thyroid hormone on the arrhythmogenic activity of pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes in rabbits. The authors found that thyroid hormone had the following effects on arrhythmogenesis 16 : 1.) Decreased APD 2.) Increased spontaneous activity in pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes 3.) Increased occurrence of delayed after-depolarizations in pulmonary vein beating and non-beating cardiomyocytes 4.) Increased after-depolarizations in beating cardiomyocytes Decreased APD Increased spontaneous activity in pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes Increased occurrence of delayed after-depolarizations in pulmonary vein beating and non-beating cardiomyocytes Increased after-depolarizations in beating cardiomyocytes With the following changes noted, the authors concluded that thyroid hormone plays a role on arrhythmogenesis with an increase of triggered activity or automaticity in pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes. 16 Atrial fibrillation in hyperthyroid human patients, similar to the animal models as discussed is believed to be due to a decreased atrial refractory period and increased sympathetic tone with decreased heart-rate variability. 17 Wustmann and colleagues noted that hyperthyroid patients with no known diagnosis of atrial fibrillation when compared to euthyroid patients without a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation were found to have an increased incidence of supraventricular depolarizations which normalized after treating the hyperthyroidism. 18 While these supraventricular depolarizations have been linked to developing atrial fibrillation in patients who are euthyroid, Wustmann and colleagues did not attempt to prove any causal relationship in hyperthyroid patients. Another study performed by Komiya and colleagues showed that when invasive electrophysiological tests were performed on hyperthyroid patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, in comparison to the control group, there was no increased incidence of abnormal atrial electrograms, whereas those with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who were euthyroid had a significantly increased incidence of abnormal atrial electrograms when compared to the control. Komiya and colleagues also noted that in patients who were euthyroid, atrial refractory period was not reduced in comparison to controls. 19 Interestingly, the only common finding noted between euthyroid and hyperthyroid patients in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation was a prolonged conduction delay and conduction zone. A flowchart illustrating the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation in hyperthyroidism is shown in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 A figure illustrating the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation in hyperthyroidism. A figure illustrating the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation in hyperthyroidism. Sawin and his group reported a 2.8-fold increased risk of atrial fibrillation in subclinical hyperthyroid individuals over the age of 60. 20 Subsequent studies reported similar results. 21 , 22 The Rotterdam study performed by Heeringa and colleagues, showed a graded response in patients with atrial fibrillation and thyroxine levels and lower TSH. 11 The mechanism involved was hypothesized by Heeringa and colleagues and is believed to be threefold: 1 Active T 3 binds to T3 Nuclear receptors resulting in specific cardiac gene expression 2 T3 Reduces heart rate variability by reducing vagal tone increasing risk for arrhythmias 3 T3 causes peripheral vasodilation increasing cardiac preload and altering contraction Active T 3 binds to T3 Nuclear receptors resulting in specific cardiac gene expression T3 Reduces heart rate variability by reducing vagal tone increasing risk for arrhythmias T3 causes peripheral vasodilation increasing cardiac preload and altering contraction TSH has also been identified as an independent predictor of developing atrial fibrillation with lower limits of normal increasing risk regardless of free T4 levels in patients greater than age 60 within the next decade. 20 While no guidelines are available regarding the frequency of monitoring thyroid function, the association noted prompts close monitoring of thyroid function status in the elderly per clinician discretion. Cardioversion may be an option in those who remain in atrial fibrillation after 8–10 weeks of remaining in a euthyroid state with anticoagulation for at least three weeks due to the concern of atrial stunning. In patients with atrial fibrillation who are of euthyroid or hyperthyroid status at the time of diagnosis, it is important to note that the chances of failed cardioversion dramatically increase with time. A large risk for recurrence is noted 1 year after diagnosis and even larger risk of recurrence 2 years after diagnosis. 23 In a study performed by Gurdogan and colleagues, irrespective of thyroid status, prolonged duration of atrial fibrillation prior to cardioversion was a poor predictor for sustaining sinus rhythm. 24 Further studies are required to identify those who are good candidates for cardioversion when there is a history of hyperthyroidism. In patients with hyperthyroidism related atrial fibrillation, there is no clear consensus in the present literature regarding the efficacy of catheter ablation. Ma et al. studied the efficacy of circumferential pulmonary vein ablation in patients with thyrotoxic atrial fibrillation and found that it was a viable therapeutic option. 25 A case-control study evaluating the efficacy of catheter ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with a history of AIT found that a single ablation with pulmonary vein isolation had a lower efficacy when compared to patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation without a history of AIT. A history of AIT was also found to be an independent predictor of atrial tachycardia. After multiple ablations however, the risk of recurrence was noted to be equal in patients with and without AIT. 26 A subsequent study performed by Wang et al. studying the safety and efficacy of early radiofrequency catheter ablation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation complicated with AIT found that pulmonary vein isolation was safe and efficacious with a higher incidence of atrial tachyarrhythmias occurring up to three months post procedure but were not noted 12 months post procedure when matched with controls. 27 In a separate study performed by Machino et al., the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation with pulmonary vein isolation was tested in patients who had a history of hyperthyroidism and were euthyroid for a period of three months and matched with a control group of patients with atrial fibrillation without a history of hyperthyroidism. The authors found that there was no difference in risk of occurrence of atrial fibrillation in both groups. 28 Another study performed by Wongcharoen et al. showed that patients with a history of hyperthyroidism had more frequent ectopic events and a higher risk of occurrence of atrial fibrillation after a single ablation. 29 In this study however, the risk of recurrence was not tested after multiple ablations. In the majority of studies, ablation was considered after restoring a euthyroid state for at least three months and was indicated for refractory atrial fibrillation. Thus we conclude that in those patients who have permenant, refractory atrial fibrillation despite restoration of a euthyroid state, ablation may be considered. However, owing to the higher risk of recurrence, multiple ablations are usually required. Atrial Fibrillation has been known to significantly increase the risk of developing stroke and thrombotic episodes. The current guidelines use the CHA2DS2-VASC scoring system to predict who is at increased risk for a thrombotic episode and would benefit from anticoagulation. Atrial Fibrillation with hyperthyroidism has been studied in various trials with varying results. As per an analysis performed by Presti and Hart regarding several older trials, hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation have been shown to independently increase the risk of a thrombotic episode regardless of CHA2DS2-VASC score, particularly embolic events to the central nervous system early in the course of the disease. 30 In a large recent trial conducted in China by Chan et al., of 9727 Chinese patients with nonvalvular AF from July 1997 to December 2011, hyperthyroidism with atrial fibrillation was not known to independently increase the risk of thrombotic events with the risk for thrombosis based of the traditional risk factors outlined in the CHA2DS2-VASC score. 31 Two major recommendations are present regarding anticoagulation in those with atrial fibrillation and hyperthyroidism. As per the American College of Chest Physicians, hyperthyroidism was not found to be an independent risk factor of thrombosis in those with atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation should be based of the traditional CHA2DS2-VASC score. 31 , 32 According to the American College of Cardiology however, hyperthyroidism independently increases the risk for development of stroke or thrombosis and patients should receive anticoagulation during the hyperthyroid phase regardless of CHA2DS2-VASC score. 33 In a study performed by de Souza and colleagues, in patients with hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation, a traditional CHADS2 score was used to predict who would benefit from anticoagulation with a subsequent TEE performed to assess the efficacy of the score in identifying possible thrombogenic milieu. In this study it was found that only age was an accurate predictor of thrombogenic milieu with the remaining risk factors having a low yield. 34 This study further delineates that the decision to initiate anticoagulation in patients who have hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation may ideally be done on an individual basis. In the majority of cases, the cause of hyperthyroidism is either secondary to autoimmune (graves) disease, toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma. The mainstay of treatment is B-blockade and treatment with an anti-thyroid agent (PTU or methimazole). While B-blocker therapy is first line to manage narrow complex tachyarrhythmias in the setting of thyrotoxicosis, in certain cases of tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy there may be a concern for hemodynamic compromise. In such cases a short acting B-blocker such as esmolol may be given to assess tolerability. 23 Digoxin may also be considered in those with a tenuous hemodynamic status. However, due to a few factors; increased renal clearance, increased sympathetic tone in atrial fibrillation with reduced vagal tone and a large volume of distribution of digoxin, a larger than usual dose of digoxin is required, thus caution must be used to avoid digoxin toxicity. 35 , 36 In patient’s where B-blocker therapy is contraindicated, other management choices include calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem or verapamil. These agents should however be avoided in those with a reduced ejection fraction or hemodynamic instability due to a strong negative inotropic effect. Amiodarone may be used in the acute setting due to the benefit of converting the patient to normal sinus rhythm when combined with anti-thyroid medications such as PTU to reduce the chance of worsening thyrotoxicosis. 37 Caution must be used however due to the risk of atrial stunning and thrombogenic phenomenon if not properly anticoagulated. Regarding anticoagulation, at present, there is no consensus on the recommendation for anticoagulation during thyroid storm. Elevated thyroxine levels in thyroid storm are known to theoretically increase the risk of a thrombotic event secondary to a metabolic change that occurs in these patients namely: increased levels of Factor VIII, Factor IX, fibrinogen, vWF, plasminogen activator-inhibitor-1 and deficiency of antithrombin III with increased clearance of circulating heparin. 38 , 39 The choice to anticoagulate patients in thyroid storm is per the clinician’s decision. Some clinicians choose to anticoagulate based of CHA2DS2-VASC score whereas others anticoagulate during the thyrotoxic phase regardless of other thrombotic risk factors. Rhythm control is usually not recommended in patients with hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation as nearly two-thirds of patients revert to normal sinus rhythm 8–10 weeks after achieving a euthyroid state. 40 In those patients who continue to remain in atrial fibrillation after achieving a euthyroid state, rhythm control may be an option however like the general atrial fibrillation population, rate control is usually preferred initially. Options for rhythm control include class IA, IC as well as class III agents. The use of amiodarone may be indicated acutely as mentioned above during a thyroid storm to restore sinus rhythm or for chronic therapy in those with atrial fibrillation refractory to rate control. While the use of amiodarone has not been clearly studied in those with thyrotoxic atrial fibrillation, amiodarone is known to cause hyperthyroidism as well as hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism secondary to amiodarone is known as amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) and has been further sub classified into two categories. AIT has an incidence of approximately 3% in North America with an incidence of 10% for those living in iodine-depleted areas. 41 AIT Type I occurs in patients with underlying thyroid disease wherein the iodine load from amiodarone therapy (75 mg of iodine per 200 mg oral tablet) results in increased production of T3 and T4 known as the Jod- Basedow phenomenon. 42 AIT Type 2 is secondary to an autoimmune destructive thyroiditis where in T3 and T4 is released from the thyroid gland. This is secondary to an elevated concentration of iodide from pharmacological therapy resulting in inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis and release of stored hormone from the thyroid gland known as the Wolf-Chaikoff effect. 43 AIT type 1 has a higher incidence in countries with iodine deficient regions whereas AIT type 2 is more common in iodine replete areas. 44 In a study performed by Czarnywojtek et al., in patients who were previously hyperthyroid and underwent radioactive ablation of the thyroid gland (presently euthyroid), the efficacy of administering radioactive iodine was assessed prior to initiating amiodarone therapy despite being euthyroid at the time of administration. As per this study the authors concluded that the use of preventive radioactive iodine in euthyroid patients who were previously hyperthyroid prior to chronic amiodarone therapy was found to reduce the incidence of thyrotoxicosis and subsequently help sustain sinus rhythm. Of note 5 patients required an additional dose of radioactive iodine during this study. 45 In another study performed by Kunii et al., the efficacy of Bepridil was tested in converting patients with atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm in those with and without co-morbid hyperthyroidism. The authors found that Bepidril was equally efficacious irrespective of thyroid status. 46 However, owing to the untoward effects of Bepidril such as the risk of Torsade de pointe, the drug has been banned in several countries and should be used cautiously. In patients with overt hyperthyroidism without atrial fibrillation, thyroid treatment is warranted to reduce the risk of this potential complication. Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism should be done in individuals older than 65 and with a TSH level of <0.1 mU/L. If the patient is less than 65 year-old and TSH >0.1, treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism should be done if the individual has symptoms or has other risk factors i.e. heart disease or bisphosphonate treatment. 1 , 47 The prognosis of those with hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation has not been previously studied to our knowledge. However, identifying that hyperthyroidism is a causative factor of atrial fibrillation plays a crucial role in management as outlined above. Similarly, while the prevalence of hypothyroidism is significantly higher in those with atrial fibrillation when compared to hyperthyroidism, in a large study performed by Selmer et al. as mentioned above, routine follow up with patients after the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation showed that the incidence of hyperthyroidism was significantly higher when matched with those without a history of atrial fibrillation. 6 Thus while no current guidelines are available, routine screening with TSH levels after the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation may help with early detection of hyperthyroidism and decrease the risk of metabolic and cardiovascular side effects.Sawin and his group reported a 2.8-fold increased risk of atrial fibrillation in subclinical hyperthyroid individuals over the age of 60. 20 Subsequent studies reported similar results. 21 , 22 The Rotterdam study performed by Heeringa and colleagues, showed a graded response in patients with atrial fibrillation and thyroxine levels and lower TSH. 11 The mechanism involved was hypothesized by Heeringa and colleagues and is believed to be threefold: 1 Active T 3 binds to T3 Nuclear receptors resulting in specific cardiac gene expression 2 T3 Reduces heart rate variability by reducing vagal tone increasing risk for arrhythmias 3 T3 causes peripheral vasodilation increasing cardiac preload and altering contraction Active T 3 binds to T3 Nuclear receptors resulting in specific cardiac gene expression T3 Reduces heart rate variability by reducing vagal tone increasing risk for arrhythmias T3 causes peripheral vasodilation increasing cardiac preload and altering contraction TSH has also been identified as an independent predictor of developing atrial fibrillation with lower limits of normal increasing risk regardless of free T4 levels in patients greater than age 60 within the next decade. 20 While no guidelines are available regarding the frequency of monitoring thyroid function, the association noted prompts close monitoring of thyroid function status in the elderly per clinician discretion.Cardioversion may be an option in those who remain in atrial fibrillation after 8–10 weeks of remaining in a euthyroid state with anticoagulation for at least three weeks due to the concern of atrial stunning.

Causative factors are vast with differences in required management. In this review we focused on hyperthyroidism as a causative factor of atrial fibrillation as well as its prevalence in the population with atrial fibrillation. The goal of this review was to address several questions regarding the differences in management when co-morbid hyperthyroidism is present. The overall prognosis of having co-morbid hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation has not clearly been studied, however as the risk of recurrence is similar amongst the euthyroid and hyperthyroid groups, we are lead to believe the over all prognosis of hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation is similar to those with atrial fibrillation when matched for other variables. Further studies may be indicated to help guide management, however, this review aims to summarize the current major goals in the management of this population.None.',\n",

Both incidence and prevalence are expected to double in the next 20 years, with huge impact on hospital admissions, costs and patient quality of life. Patient wellbeing determines the management strategy for atrial fibrillation, including the use of rhythm control therapy and the clinical success of heart rate control. Hence, evaluation of quality of life is an emerging and important part of the assessment of patients with atrial fibrillation. Although a number of questionnaires to assess quality of life in atrial fibrillation are available, a comprehensive overview of their measurement properties is lacking. We performed a systematic review of the measurement properties of atrial fibrillation-specific health-related quality of life questionnaires. Methodological quality was assessed using the Consensus based Standards for selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist, with measurement properties rated for quality against optimal criteria and levels of evidence. We screened 2,216 articles, of which eight articles describing five questionnaires were eligible for inclusion: Atrial Fibrillation 6 (AF6), Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-Life (AFEQT), Atrial Fibrillation Quality of Life Questionnaire (AFQLQ), Atrial Fibrillation Quality of Life (AFQoL), and Quality of Life in Atrial Fibrillation (QLAF). Good reliability (internal consistency and test-retest reliability) was demonstrated for AF6, AFEQT, AFQLQ and AFQoL. Content, construct and criterion validity were positively rated only in AFEQT. Responsiveness was positively rated only in AFEQT, but with limited evidence. Overall, AFEQT showed strong positive evidence for 2 of 9 measurement properties, compared to one for AFQoL and none for the remaining questionnaires. Given the low ratings for many measurement properties, no single questionnaire can be recommended, although AFEQT performed strongest. Further studies to robustly assess reliability, validity and responsiveness of AF-specific quality of life questionnaires are required. This review consolidates the current evidence for quality of life assessment in patients with atrial fibrillation and identifies priority areas for future research.',\n",
       "  'article_text': \"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is predicted to double in prevalence over the next 20 years. It is not only associated with adverse prognosis, but accounts for considerable healthcare expenditure. Numerous studies have identified a substantial reduction in health-related quality of life (QoL) in AF populations. Patients with AF experience symptoms such as palpitations, exercise intolerance, dizziness and dyspnea, which frequently limit capacity to undertake daily activities. Apart from anticoagulation to prevent strokes, current management of AF is focused on reducing symptoms and improving QoL. Even well-established therapies in AF have proven to have little impact on death and other adverse outcomes, including rate and rhythm control therapy. Although the fundamental reason for pursing such therapies is to improve QoL, there is limited appreciation of how to measure QoL in clinical practice. A variety of both generic and AF-specific questionnaires are available to assess patient-reported QoL. Generic patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), such as the SF-36 and EQ-5D questionnaires, have the advantage of allowing comparison of QoL in patients with different diseases, but are less sensitive to the effects of a single disease on QoL. With the growing burden of AF, the relatively high cost of treatment, and the appreciation of QoL as a treatment objective, there has been substantial interest in the development of AF-specific PROMs for use in both clinical research and routine practice. However, these have yet to enter routine clinical practice, in part due to concerns about their validity and responsiveness. Our objective was to perform a systematic review of the measurement properties of disease-specific PROMs measuring QoL in AF, assessing studies which designed and validated the questionnaires. We aim to provide clinicians with an understanding of whether these instruments would likely be of value in research and clinical practice. We utilized a comprehensive methodology from the Consensus based Standards for selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) group , which includes rigorous assessment of validity, reliability, and responsiveness of QoL questionnaires.We included all studies that examined at least one or more measurement properties of a disease-specific PROM measuring QoL in patients with AF (aged 18 years and older). We permitted inclusion of studies with interviewer-based administration, as long as questionnaires were self-reported by patients. Studies were required to be published as a full-text article. Articles were excluded if the article failed to specify the type of tool utilized. There was no restriction on language, date of publication or type of AF. A systematic search was performed in Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL from inception until the 15 th February 2015 and in the Cochrane library from 1993 to 9 th March 2015. The search strategy (see S1 Appendix ) consisted of 3 filters composed of search terms for the following: (1) AF; (2) PROMs; and (3) measurement properties. The latter two filters were developed at the University of Oxford and VU University Medical Center respectively (available at www.cosmin.nl ). All filters were adapted for each database. Reference lists of the included studies were also manually searched in addition to articles that cited them. This review was prospectively registered with the PROSPERO database of systematic reviews ( http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.asp?ID=CRD42015016600 ). In this paper, we report on our primary outcome which addresses the quality of AF-specific PROMs using the COSMIN methodology. For each study, two investigators independently extracted and tabulated data on a standardized data extraction form. Discrepancies and missing data were resolved by group discussion, reference to the original publication and additional adjudication. Two studies published in Japanese were first translated by a Cardiologist fluent in both the Japanese and English languages. The COSMIN checklist was used by two independent reviewers to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. This tool distinguishes three main domains (reliability, validity and responsiveness), subdivided into nine measurement properties. For each measurement property, numerous standards are included in the form of questions to determine the quality of the study. Each item per measurement property is scored as excellent, fair, good or poor, with the lowest rating determining the overall quality score for that study (“worst score counts” method). Measurement properties were rated for quality against criteria for optimal measurement properties. Each result was rated as either positive (+), negative (-) or indeterminate (?), providing that methodological quality was not poor. Table 1 summarizes the definitions of the nine measurement properties assessed and the preferred methods for their assessment, based on the COSMIN taxonomy, with detailed criteria presented in S1 Table . Best evidence synthesis was performed by applying levels of evidence developed by Terwee et al . ( www.cosmin.nl ), combining the ratings of study quality with the strength of findings to determine an overall judgement for each questionnaire, as demonstrated in S2 Table .We included all studies that examined at least one or more measurement properties of a disease-specific PROM measuring QoL in patients with AF (aged 18 years and older).

A summary of studies excluded at the full-text stage is presented in S3 Table . Study inclusion flowchart. See S1 Appendix for search strategy. We identified five questionnaires developed and validated for the assessment of quality of life in AF: Atrial Fibrillation 6 (AF6) , Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-Life (AFEQT) , Atrial Fibrillation Quality of Life Questionnaire (AFQLQ) , Atrial Fibrillation Quality of Life (AFQoL) , and Quality of Life in Atrial Fibrillation (QLAF). The characteristics of the questionnaires included in this review and the study populations in which their measurement properties were evaluated are summarized in Table 2 . The QoL questionnaires were assessed in a variety of geographical locations, however patients were of a similar mean age (62–67 years). Women were under-represented in all of the cohorts (20–43%). The type of AF varied in the individual studies, although on average there was an even split between paroxysmal and more persistent forms. Results of the assessment of validity for each instrument are detailed in S4 Table and for reliability and responsiveness in S5 Table . It was not possible to rate any of the instruments in relation to measurement error, as statistical evaluations were not reported. Similarly, there were no data on cross cultural validity, and hence study quality and instrument ratings were not performed for these domains. A summary of findings is presented in Fig 2 . Best evidence synthesis to provide an overall appraisal of each questionnaire is detailed in Table 3 , limited by the availability of only one or two published articles for each questionnaire. Below, we concisely review the main results for the individual QoL instruments alphabetically. For each measurement property, the PROM is assessed for methodological quality of the study (excellent, good, fair or poor) and given an overall rating (positive , negative or indeterminate/unknown ) for the results. A level of evidence was applied, combining the number and quality of the studies with the strength of findings. Studies that have poor quality are given an ‘indeterminate /unknown’ rating due to the limited level of evidence. For AFQoL, reliability was assessed differently in the two related studies. * Insufficient data were available to rate this criterion. See Table 1 for assessment criteria. AF6 was evaluated in 2 articles, both utilizing the same cohort of 111 patients recruited in Sweden. Reliability: The quality of the study was fair for internal consistency and reliability, with both of these measurement properties rated positively. Internal consistency was only evaluated in patients who underwent direct current cardioversion (which may not be representative of general AF patients and can variably affect QoL depending on success). Test-retest reliability was only assessed in 9 patients who had failed cardioversion, with 3 of the 6 items (limitations in daily life due to AF, discomfort due to AF and fatigue due to AF) associated with poor coefficient values. Validity: Content validity and hypothesis testing of this instrument were rated as indeterminate due to poor ratings for reported methodology. For criterion validity, appropriate statistics were not reported. Structural validity assessment was deemed of fair quality overall, although statistical methods and handling of missing data were excellent and the instrument was positively rated for this measurement property. Responsiveness: Only assessed in a single study of poor methodological quality, which did not describe the construct of the comparator (SF-36) or detail the handling of missing data or the underlying hypotheses. Synthesis: Two measurement properties was positively rated based on limited evidence. AFEQT was evaluated in a single article composed of 213 patients recruited from hospitals across North America. The population was predominantly of European descent and English-speaking. Reliability: The quality of the study was excellent for internal consistency and fair for test-retest reliability, due to inadequate information regarding the environment of questionnaire administration. Both measurement properties were rated as positive. Validity: The quality of the study on content validity was deemed methodologically excellent, whereas the quality of the study regarding structural validity, hypothesis testing and criterion validity were rated fair as the handling of missing data was not detailed. All of these validity aspects were rated positive. Responsiveness: Although there was excellent description of hypotheses, comparators and methods, the overall quality of the study was rated fair, as responsiveness was only assessed in cohorts of patients who received an intervention (66 patients with medication adjustment and 76 with ablation). It was unclear how missing data were handled, and the expected or achieved correlations were not reported. The responsiveness of the instrument was however, rated as positive (data presented in S5 Table ). Comparison with generic QoL measures (SF-36 and EQ-5D) resulted in smaller effect sizes, although the responsiveness of the AFEQT was comparable to the Toronto AF Symptoms Check List and Atrial Fibrillation Severity Scale. Synthesis: Two measurement properties showed strong positive evidence, and four were positive based on limited evidence. AFQLQ was studied in two articles, both recruiting patients from Japan. Reliability: Assessed in a single article, quality was categorized as methodically fair for both internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Although the sample size was >100, both measurement properties were marked down due to inadequate information on missing data and potential differences in test conditions during resampling. Both measurement properties were rated positive. Validity: Structural validity was investigated in a single article. The study was methodologically fair as assessment was only performed in a small number of patients and the handling of missing data was not clearly reported. The instrument was positively rated for structural validity. No information was available on other validity aspects. Responsiveness: Assessed in a single article , this study was rated as methodically poor. It was unclear if changes occurred in the patients during the interim period, either in treatment or symptoms, and the study failed to detail expected hypotheses. Synthesis: Three positive measurement properties with limited evidence, however there was insufficient data to rate 5 out of 9 measurement properties. AFQoL was assessed in two articles recruiting Spanish patients from hospitals across Madrid and Bilbao. Reliability: An evaluation of internal consistency was rated as methodologically fair in both articles, whereas test-retest was rated fair in one and poor in the other , due to the relatively small sample size, uncertainty if the test conditions were the same, and lack of details regarding the handling of missing data. The instrument was rated positive for internal consistency in both articles , but indeterminate for test-retest reliability. Validity: Content validity and structural validity were assessed in a single article. The quality of content validity assessment was methodologically excellent, while structural validity was deemed fair due to omission of details on the handling of missing data. The instrument was rated positively for both of these measurement properties. The study on hypothesis testing was methodologically poor due to a lack of detail on the self-perceived health status scale employed, hence the instrument was rated indeterminate. Criterion validity was assessed in a single article , with fair study quality but an indeterminate rating as QoL was compared with patients post-myocardial infarction. Responsiveness: Assessed in a single article of poor methodologically quality , as only correlations between baseline SF-36 and AFQoL were reported. Synthesis: One measurement property showed strong positive evidence, and two were positive based on limited evidence. QLAF was assessed in a single article consisting of 63 patients recruited from centers across Brazil. Reliability: The assessment of internal consistency was rated as methodically poor as factor analysis was not performed. Study quality for test-retest reliability was fair, due to the small sample size and insufficient detail on the handling of missing items. The instrument was rated as positive for this measurement property. Validity: Content validity was rated as methodologically poor, as the questionnaire was administered to a small target population and there was no patient involvement in the questionnaire design. Prior hypotheses regarding expected correlations between the SF-36 and QLAF were not stated when undertaking hypothesis testing and appropriate statistics were not used during criterion validity assessment; thus both construct and criterion validity were rated as methodologically poor. Responsiveness: Poor study quality due to a lack of appropriate statistical analysis. Synthesis: One measurement property showed positive evidence based on limited evidence.The results of the search strategy are outlined in Fig 1 .

To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate the methodological quality of studies and the measurement properties of QoL questionnaires in AF patients. Our key finding was the lack of robust psychometric testing of any of the currently available AF-specific QoL instrument, particularly for measurement error. We found deficiencies in most instruments in relation to reliability, construct and criterion validity, but particularly in the responsiveness of questionnaires. The results raise important questions about the use of these instruments in research and daily clinical practice, and suggest the need for further evaluation before implementation. Quality of life encompasses a person's perceptions of their physical and psychological state, social relationships and environment. Many generic and disease-specific questionnaires exist to assess QoL in AF patients. The Short Form 36 (SF-36) is perhaps the most common generic QoL measure , and often used as a gold-standard comparator in the validation of other questionnaires (although as there is no ‘true’ gold-standard measure, criterion validity remains problematic to adequately appraise). Generic measures are useful to determine overall QoL in the population, particularly to quantify health utility or for comparing between diseases and populations. However, they may not be as sensitive to the effect of a single disease on QoL , whereas disease-specific questionnaires assess domains more relevant to the particular condition and may provide more targeted information to inform shared-decision making. There is increasing interest in evaluating the effect of management strategies on QoL among AF patients, but for clinical confidence, the tool used should demonstrate good responsiveness, in addition to being a reliable and valid measure. Indeed, a recently developed QoL questionnaire for patients undergoing catheter ablation for cardiac arrhythmias has demonstrated responsiveness to clinical change. This review utilized the COSMIN approach for performing the systematic review. The COSMIN taxonomy was developed after an international Delphi study , using a consensus of terminology across validation studies and allowing standardized objective assessment of measurement properties. Further, the group have developed standards (the COSMIN checklist) for how measurement properties should be evaluated and provide a structured protocol for undertaking such reviews to a high quality ( http://www.cosmin.nl/ ). The COSMIN methodology has been incorporated into several other reviews to evaluate PROM assessment across a variety of diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , osteoarthritis , cancer , multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s Disease. Whilst the standards within COSMIN are high, the thresholds for reliability are in line with the International Society for Quality of Life Research (ISOQOL) requirements. It could be argued that high standards are needed to drive improvements in the methodology of development and validation of PROMs, and allow clinicians to have greater confidence in their use. As with any system based on scientific judgment, our results based on the COSMIN approach are only one component of evaluating quality of life questionnaires. A specific limitation of our review was the inclusion of questionnaires developed and validated before the COSMIN checklist became widely available, which may have impacted on the scores assigned for methodological quality. This may be less of an issue in future reviews, where validation studies would ideally have incorporated the COSMIN checklist. There are other methodologies available for evaluating PROMs, for example the Federal Drug Administration scheme, which utilizes broadly similar assessment categories. However, the COSMIN approach offers a more quantifiable appraisal of measurement properties. Secondly, the inclusion of two Japanese papers requiring translation meant these articles were assessed by a sole reviewer, which may impact on internal validity. We are also limited to the ‘general’ AF populations studied, whereas patients with specific comorbidities may respond differently to PROMs. For example, heart failure is a common comorbidity in AF that is underrepresented in the studies evaluated. The content of these questionnaires demonstrates some similarities among them, with 4 out of 5 examining the type and/or frequency of symptoms (the only exception being AFQoL), and all except QLAF assessing the impact of AF on daily activities, physical and psychological functioning, albeit to differing extent. Synthesis of results in our review showed that AFEQT demonstrated strong positive evidence for internal consistency and content validity and AFQoL showed strong positive evidence for content validity. All other questionnaires failed to provide sufficient evidence to make a strong positive rating. Neither measurement error nor cross-cultural validity were appropriately assessed in any study and there were limited data for responsiveness, which we were only able to rate for AFEQT. Where study quality was poor, or ratings indeterminate, this does not mean that a particular questionnaire performed badly, only that the evidence was limited. For example, AFQoL, in addition to AFEQT, demonstrated strong positive evidence for content validity, an important measurement property that is the foundation of a good QoL questionnaire. Refinements to AF PROMs are ongoing, and AFQLQ was recently updated to a second version, demonstrating good intra- and inter-observer reproducibility and internal consistency in 40 AF patients. However, even with full information on psychometric properties, clinical validity requires further appraisal in large-scale AF populations, a review of which is beyond the scope of this methodological assessment. Apart from AFEQT , there is limited information about the minimally important change seen with these questionnaires. With the growing burden of AF and the equivocal benefit of rate or rhythm-control strategies in improving mortality , there is increasing importance of QoL assessment. Over 34 different QoL questionnaires have been utilized in published AF studies emphasizing the current lack of consensus on the best instrument to assess QoL. Our assessment of methodological quality suggests that reported results for the available instruments should be treated with caution and that further, more robust validation is required to determine if these measures are appropriate to assess QoL in clinical populations. However, adequate measurement properties are just one aspect of whether a QoL tool is useful in research and clinical practice. Cost, ease of administration, time taken and patient acceptability are also important considerations. Future studies are clearly required that address the detectable change in scores, as well as the responsiveness of the questionnaire to changes in patient symptoms and management strategies in the clinical setting. One such study that is due to commence shorty is the RAte Control Therapy Evaluation in Atrial Fibrillation (RATE-AF) randomized trial. Using the systematic COSMIN approach, we have identified clear deficiencies in the five available instruments for assessing disease-specific quality of life in patients with atrial fibrillation. The strongest performing tool was AFEQT, but further evidence for test-retest reliability, measurement error and responsiveness are required before recommending routine clinical implementation.(DOCX) Click here for additional data file.

       "  'abstract_text': 'Several studies have investigated the impact of body mass index (BMI) on the prognosis of atrial fibrillation, but the results remain controversial. We sought to estimate the association of BMI with atrial fibrillation–related outcomes. We systematically searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Elsevier databases for all studies reporting associations between BMI and atrial fibrillation–related outcomes. Relative risks ( RR s) and 95% CIs were extracted and pooled. Nine studies with 49 364 participants were included. Underweight BMI was associated with an increased risk of stroke or systemic embolism ( RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.12–2.49), all‐cause mortaliity ( RR 2.61, 95% CI 2.21–3.09), and cardiovascular death ( RR 2.49, 95% CI 1.38–4.50). Nevertheless, the pooled RR s of overweight and obese patients were lower than those of normal‐weight patients for stroke or systemic embolism (overweight: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80–1.04; obese: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72–0.98; grade 1 obesity: RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71–1.11; grade 2 obesity: RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45–0.91; grade 3 obesity: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.54–1.25), all‐cause death (overweight: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62–0.96; obese: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.64–1.10; grade 1 obesity: RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.57–0.73; grade 2 obesity: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.47–1.03; grade 3 obesity: RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59–0.88), and cardiovascular death (overweight: RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.58–1.08; obese: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79–1.24). Underweight BMI is associated with an increased risk of stroke or systemic embolism, cardiovascular death, and all‐cause death in Asian patients with atrial fibrillation, whereas in all atrial fibrillation patients, overweight and obese BMI was not associated with increased risks of these outcomes.',\n",
       "  'article_text': 'Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most frequent type of cardiac rhythm disorder in clinical practice, is associated with elevated cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality. Because of the increased incidence and prevalence of AF, more attention has been placed on the management and prevention of AF. 1 It is well known that AF is not only closely associated with stroke or systemic embolism (SSE) but also associated with all‐cause death. 2 Although several risk‐scoring systems have shown modest predictive ability for stroke risk, most variables considered in those systems are not modifiable risk factors. To improve the estimation of stroke risk, it is important to explore the modifiable risk factors for clinical outcomes in AF patients. Obesity is a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, 3 and body mass index (BMI; in kg/m 2 ) is the most commonly used anthropometric measure of the degree of adiposity. Prior studies have reported that obesity is an independent risk factor for the incidence, recurrence, and progression of AF. 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 A previous meta‐analysis of 97 studies found that overweight BMI (25 to <30) was significantly associated with lower all‐cause mortality and that moderate obesity (BMI 30 to <35) was not associated with higher mortality. 8 Consequently, it seems that overweight and moderately obese patients have more favorable prognosis than those with normal BMI. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been referred to as the “obesity paradox.” To date, the existence of the obesity paradox has been documented in patients with noncardiovascular diseases, including diabetes mellitus, 9 , 10 chronic kidney disease 11 (particularly among hemodialysis patients 12 ), and stroke 13 as well as cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease, 14 hypertension, 15 and heart failure. 16 Nevertheless, the data on the impact of obesity on adverse outcomes in AF patients are conflicting. A cross‐sectional study of 480 AF patients showed no association between obesity and risk of thromboembolic events. 17 In the prospective Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health study, obesity was associated with a worse prognosis in AF patients. 18 In addition, a weight loss intervention program for patients with AF was able to reduce the burden of AF. 19 , 20 In contrast, an association between obesity and better survival and outcomes in AF patients has also been reported. 21 , 22 Because of these inconsistencies, the obesity paradox in AF patients is still not fully understood. The aim of this meta‐analysis was to evaluate the association between BMI and clinical outcomes in patients with AF.The protocol and reporting of the results of this meta‐analysis were based on the Meta‐Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. 23 Ethics approval was not provided because we performed this meta‐analysis using data only from published studies. We systematically searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Elsevier databases through May 2016 for studies published in any language that reported adverse outcomes of AF based on BMI. Three groups of key words were combined using the Boolean operator “and”. The first group of key words was linked to body mass (“body mass index” OR “body weight” OR “obesity” OR “overweight” OR “central obesity”). The second group was linked to the type of diagnosis (“atrial fibrillation” OR “atrial flutter” OR “atrial tachycardia” OR “supraventricular tachycardia” OR “arrhythmia”). The last group of key words was linked to outcomes (“cardiac death” OR “cardiovascular death” OR “mortality” OR “death” OR “stroke” OR “systemic embolism” OR “thromboembolism”). We also reviewed reference lists and conference abstracts to identify other relevant studies. Clinical studies were included if they fulfilled the following criteria: (1) included nonvalvular AF patients; (2) were designed as randomized controlled trials or observational (prospective or retrospective cohort) studies (post hoc analyses of randomized controlled trials were deemed equivalent to observational studies 24 ); (3) assessed primary outcomes that included SSE, all‐cause death, and cardiovascular death; and (4) assessed BMI as a categorical variable according to the standard World Health Organization (WHO) definition, 25 in which “normal weight” is defined as BMI 18.5 to <25, underweight as BMI <18.5, overweight as 25 to <30, and obese as BMI ≥30. Studies with insufficient data were excluded from this meta‐analysis. For multiple publications and reports using the same data, we included the articles with the longest follow‐up or the largest numbers of participants. Two researchers (W.G.Z. and R.W.) screened the titles and abstracts of the studies independently. The full texts of the selected titles or abstracts were reviewed for more detail using the aforementioned inclusion criteria. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion or by a third researcher (K.H.) if needed. For each study, the following data were recorded: first author, year of publication, geographic location, participants (sex, age, and sample size), follow‐up duration in years, outcomes, BMI categories, maximum adjusted covariates, and relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs. If both unadjusted and adjusted RRs existed in 1 study, the most completely adjusted RRs were extracted. The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) items, with a total score of 9 stars, were used to evaluate the quality of the observational studies. 26 We defined studies with a NOS score ≥6 stars as moderate to high quality and studies with a NOS score <6 stars as low quality. All statistical analyses were performed using Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.30 software (Nordic Cochrane Center; http://ims.cochrane.org/revman ). The RRs were used as the common risk estimates and then were pooled by the software. To examine the influence of individual studies on the pooled results, a sensitivity analysis was performed by removing each study. Consistency was evaluated using the Cochrane Q test as well as the I 2 statistic. I 2 values of ≤25%, 50%, and ≥75% represented low, moderate, and high inconsistency, respectively. To estimate the pooled RRs more conservatively, we used random rather than fixed‐effects models because the former is better able to explain the between‐study heterogeneity. A subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were performed to explore the sources of heterogeneity if appropriate. A funnel plot was drawn to assess the degree of possible publication bias. A visually significant asymmetry in the funnel plots indicated major publication bias. A P <0.05 indicated statistical significance.We systematically searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Elsevier databases through May 2016 for studies published in any language that reported adverse outcomes of AF based on BMI.

Two studies further categorized obesity into grade 1 (BMI 30 to <35), grade 2 (BMI 35 to <40), and grade 3 (BMI ≥40). 37 , 41 There was a linear increase in age from the obese patients (67.3±1.6 years) to the underweight patients (80.4±1.8 years). As shown in Table 2 , the reporting quality of the included studies was globally acceptable because all studies had a NOS score of ≥6 stars.

In contrast, overweight BMI was associated with a decreased risk of all‐cause death (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62–0.96; P =0.02), and obesity was not associated with an increased risk of all‐cause death (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.64–1.10; P =0.21). In addition, the summary RRs were 0.64 (95% CI 0.57–0.73), 0.70 (95% CI 0.47–1.03), and 0.72 (95% CI 0.59–0.88) for grade 1, 2, and 3 obesity, respectively (Table 3 ).

None of the studies further categorized obesity into grades 1 to 3 when considering the relationship between BMI and cardiovascular death.

The pooled RRs of SSE, all‐cause death, and cardiovascular death from all studies are presented in the Figure 5 . In the sensitivity analysis, after omitting 1 study at a time, none of the aforementioned RR values changed substantially. Specifically, after we removed the retrospective study by Wang et al, 40 the results also remained stable. The RR values mentioned above changed only slightly when we redid these analyses with fixed‐effects models. The pooled relative risks of stroke or systemic embolism, all‐cause death, and cardiovascular death from all studies.For the meta‐analysis of the reported adverse outcomes of AF based on BMI, a possible lack of publication bias was observed by inspecting the funnel plot (Figure 6 ).

AF indicates atrial fibrillation; RR , relative risk; SE , standard error.In the present study, underweight BMI was associated with increased risks of SSE, cardiovascular death, and all‐cause death, whereas both overweight and obesity were associated with decreased risks of these outcomes. All included studies adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors and other potential confounders; therefore, the observed associations were less likely to be related to confounding factors. In addition, these results were stable in the sensitivity analyses. All studies classified their patients using the standard WHO BMI categories. To the best of our knowledge, our meta‐analysis is the first to quantify the association between BMI and adverse outcomes in AF patients. The present results indicate that underweight BMI was significantly associated with increased risks of poor AF‐related outcomes including SSE, cardiovascular death, and all‐cause death. In addition, underweight BMI was significantly associated with increased risk of the composite end point of SSE, all‐cause death, or cardiovascular death. 35 , 42 The detailed mechanisms behind the increased risk of poor outcomes owing to low body weight remain unclear, but there are several possible explanations. Patients with low body weight are more susceptible to becoming ill as a result of poor nutritional status. 45 In addition, low body weight is correlated with poor endothelial function and worse systemic inflammation, both of which contribute to platelet aggregation and adhesion and, ultimately, SSE and death. 46 , 47 Moreover, the renin–angiotensin system is activated in patients with low body weight, leading to advanced atrial fibrosis. 48 Finally, adipokines such as leptin, adiponectin, and resistin, which are correlated with BMI, have been reported to be involved in the development of AF. 49 , 50 As shown by Haynes et al, low body weight is associated with abnormal circulating adipokine levels, 51 which may contribute to eating disorders and poor nutritional status. 52 Accordingly, it is suggested that abnormal adipokine levels could contribute to the poor outcomes in AF patients. All 3 of the relevant included studies assessed Asian patients with AF, and thus our results regarding the association between underweight and adverse outcomes may not be generalizable to AF populations in different countries. As in patients with coronary artery disease, 14 hypertension, 15 and heart failure, 16 overweight and obese patients with AF had lower risks of SSE, cardiovascular death, and all‐cause death than AF patients with normal BMI. The pooled data from 2 studies 37 , 41 further found that extreme obesity (BMI ≥40) was still associated with a reduced risk of poor AF‐related outcomes. Given the small number of studies included in this analysis, the association between extreme obesity and prognosis of AF requires further confirmation. Consistent with this finding, several studies have also demonstrated a decreased risk of AF‐related outcomes for each 1‐U increase in BMI. 21 , 30 , 31 , 36 , 41 Most of these studies were conducted in Western populations; however, the obesity standards in Asia differ from those of Western populations, and thus differences by race may exist. Nonetheless, overweight AF patients had a higher survival rate compared with underweight or normal‐weight patients in a Chinese study. 22 Among Japanese AF patients, neither overweight status nor obesity was associated with increased death. 44 In 2 prospective studies including a mixed population, 37 , 38 both overweight status and obesity were associated with decreased risks of SSE and all‐cause death. Although our meta‐analysis did not include a subgroup analysis based on race because of the limited data, we have reason to believe that an inverse association between BMI and AF‐related outcomes exists in other countries. In addition, considering the composite end points of SSE, all‐cause death, cardiovascular death, and other factors, 18 , 34 , 36 , 37 , 39 , 41 the overweight and obese groups had lower RRs of 0.87 (95% CI 0.67–1.15) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.59–1.14), respectively, than the normal‐weight group (data not shown). Furthermore, the prevalence of left atrial appendage thrombus was not increased in overweight and obese patients. 53 Consequently, an inverse association between BMI and composite end points also occurred, even in patients receiving anticoagulants. 34 A previous meta‐analysis of 16 studies showed a positive association between obesity and AF, 54 and the prevalence of AF has been shown to be increased in obesity. 55 For the first time, however, our cumulative meta‐analysis documented the existence of the obesity paradox in AF patients. The obesity paradox is a phenomenon in which overweight and obese patients with established AF seem to have a more favorable prognosis than those with normal BMI. The underlying mechanisms of the observed obesity paradox in AF patients are not well understood. A possible explanation of this phenomenon is the use of more aggressive pharmacological interventions in overweight and obese patients, who represent a population with a high prevalence of comorbidities and who require closer management of cardiovascular risks. 36 Furthermore, as reported, plasma renin and angiotensin levels, both of which lead to poor outcomes, are not as high in overweight and obese patients under stress. 56 In addition, Davos et al 57 found that higher BMI could prevent death in AF patients by providing greater metabolic reserve, namely, a better ability to withstand the increased catabolic stress of disease development. Furthermore, in adipose tissue, increased expression of tumor necrosis factor α receptor has been found, and this could help disperse inflammation and arrhythmogenic substrates that are activated in cardiomyocytes. 58 Finally, natriuretic peptide levels, which have been reported to predict stroke and mortality in AF patients, are lower in obesity. 59 , 60 Interestingly, Piepoli et al 61 demonstrated that exercise tolerance mediated the relationship between BMI and survival. Moreover, cardiorespiratory fitness mitigates the obesity paradox observed in patients with heart failure 61 , 62 , 63 and coronary heart disease. 64 Patients with relatively good preserved cardiorespiratory fitness, for example, have shown favorable prognosis regardless of their adiposity levels, and thus no obesity paradox has been observed among fit coronary heart disease patients. 64 Similarly, in AF, we hypothesized that BMI‐related cardiorespiratory fitness would greatly modify the occurrence of the obesity paradox. Physical activity is associated with small reductions in AF risk, even in overweight patients. 65 , 66 Our previous meta‐analysis found that a higher level of physical fitness was associated with a lower risk of AF. 67 Specifically, Pathak et al 68 studied obese patients with symptomatic AF who were divided into 3 groups based on their baseline cardiorespiratory fitness. After 4‐year follow‐up, the rate of AF recurrence was 88%, 65%, and 34% in the low‐, adequate‐, and high‐fitness groups, respectively. In addition, the rate of AF recurrence was 82% in the group with <2 metabolic equivalent gain but only 39% in the group with >2 metabolic equivalent gain. Whether cardiorespiratory fitness is involved in the obesity paradox in AF patients requires further investigation. In addition, genetic factors may be involved. 28 Lean patients who develop cardiovascular disease have gene variants that make them more susceptible to these illnesses and that place them at high risk when they become ill. Lean patients with cardiovascular disease may exhibit completely different etiology and genetic disposition than obese patients with the same disease, and this difference may be associated with worse clinical prognosis. Another possibility is that when chronic disease develops in lean patients, the body becomes catabolic and requires greater energy and caloric reserves than usual. If these patients lack sufficient nutritional status, they may become malnourished despite their normal body mass. The obesity paradox may be partly explained by the presence of selection bias for patients with diabetes mellitus 69 or cardiovascular disease. 70 Moreover, selection bias may be a possible explanation of the paradoxical effects of obesity on adverse outcomes in AF patients. In the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial, for example, normal‐weight patients with AF were more likely to have unmeasured confounding factors (eg, older age, abnormal renal function) other than obesity that increased their risk of AF, and this may have introduced a selection bias. If these unmeasured factors were also strong risk factors for adverse outcomes, normal‐weight patients with AF would have had a higher risk of these outcomes than obese AF patients. In this meta‐analysis, obese AF patients with higher BMI were younger than the normal‐weight patients. We speculate that obese AF patients have a higher prevalence of obesity‐related diseases (eg, coronary artery disease, cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes mellitus) that may lead to early onset of AF. Age is also a strong risk factor for stroke and death; therefore, nonobese AF patients would have had more risk factors than obese AF patients, leading to poor prognosis. Although most of the included studies adjusted for age in the multivariate analyses, it might not be possible to fully account for the differences in age between BMI groups. When analyzing observational studies on this topic in the future, we should ensure that the start of follow‐up and patient exposures coincide. 69 Despite the obesity paradox, purposeful weight reduction still results in several potentially beneficial effects in AF patients. Recent studies have indicated that lifestyle modifications (eg, weight management) may help prevent and treat AF. 71 In the Aggressive Risk Factor Reduction Study for Atrial Fibrillation and Implications for the Outcome of Ablation (ARREST‐AF), aggressive risk factor modifications (ie, weight management) improved the long‐term success of AF ablation. 72 Abed et al 19 indicated that weight reduction with intensive risk factor modification resulted in a decreased burden of AF. Weight loss alone is also associated with dose‐dependent, long‐term effects on reducing AF burden 20 , 71 and is associated with greater AF‐free survival. 68 In this meta‐analysis, however, data on weight reduction in obese patients could not be collected; therefore, the impact of targeted weight reduction was not evaluated. Our study had several potential limitations. First, the association between BMI and outcomes in AF patients may be modified by sex. 18 Future studies should address the role of sex differences in the obesity paradox. Second, the primary safety outcome of bleeding was not included in this study; the relationship between BMI and bleeding risk in AF patients remains controversial. Although 4 studies explored this relationship, 37 , 38 , 40 , 42 a pooled analysis could not be performed owing to the limited data. Third, BMI is used mainly to measure overall body size and may not assess true body adiposity. Waist circumference is also associated with decreased risks of all‐cause death and SSE in AF patients. 37 Further studies should expand the findings on the obesity paradox from BMI to other body composition parameters used to estimate the degree of adiposity. Fourth, significant heterogeneity among studies existed and may have resulted from the differences in study design, sample size, analytic strategies, and participant characteristics; however, a subgroup analysis based on these factors could not be performed owing to the limited data. Finally, although most of the included studies adjusted for a range of confounding variables, we could not exclude the effects of residual confounding, which may have partly explained the obesity paradox.Our study had several potential limitations.

Whether these findings are generalizable to all AF populations requires further confirmation; however, neither overweight BMI nor obesity was associated with increased risk of SSE, cardiovascular death, and all‐cause death in AF patients. Future studies should ensure that the start of follow‐up and patient exposures are consistent between groups.The authors wish to acknowledge support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81370288; 8153000545; 81530013) and the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program: 2013CB531103).None.',\n",

       "  'abstract_text': 'Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare resource use. The prevalence of AF is increasing with a growing and aging population, and timely access to care for these patients is a concern. Nontraditional models of care delivery, such as nurse practitioner (NP)-led clinics, may improve access to care and quality of care, but they require formal assessment. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of NP-led care on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of adult patients with AF. We plan a randomized controlled trial comparing NP-led care vs. standard care. Inclusion criteria are ≥18 years of age, documented nonvalvular AF, willingness to give informed consent, and capacity to complete questionnaires. Patients referred for electrophysiological intervention who are clinically unstable or unable to attend follow-up visits will not be eligible to participate. Patients will be asked for verbal consent during the initial triage phone call from the nurse. Randomization will occur via a secure website. The intervention includes an NP consult, including medical history, physical examination, patient teaching, treatment plan, and follow-up at 3 and 6 months. The control arm involves usual cardiologist consultation with follow-up determined by the cardiologist’s practice pattern. The primary outcome will be the difference in change in Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of Life Survey scores at 6 months between groups. Secondary outcomes will include difference in change of EQ-5D scores at 6 months between groups, difference in composite outcomes of death resulting from cardiovascular cause, hospitalizations and emergency department visits between groups, and satisfaction with NP-led care measured by the Consultant Satisfaction Questionnaire. A sample size of 70 per group will ensure adequate power despite a potential 10% loss to follow-up. Our study will determine the effect of NP-led AF care on HRQoL in patients with AF, as well as measure its impact on relevant outcomes such as death, hospitalization, and emergency department visits. Our findings may have implications for delivery of care to patients with AF. ClincalTrials.gov, NCT02745236 . Registered on 16 April 2016.

       "  'article_text': 'Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, and it is increasing in prevalence in a growing and aging population . Currently in Canada, there are approximately 350,000 people living with AF , but this number is expected to rise. Many countries are experiencing a healthcare crisis, including Canada . Increasing healthcare demands in an already overwhelmed system require new methods of care delivery to be examined. AF is a chronic disease associated with devastating complications such as stroke and heart failure . Patients with AF have a three to five times greater risk of stroke, with strokes typically larger and associated with higher mortality than in patients without AF . There are evidence-based guidelines for treatment for AF in Canada that promote evidence-based practice and improved patient outcomes, including improved quality of life (QoL) and symptom control. Early intervention and individualized assessment are fundamental for optimal AF management. Currently, healthcare in Canada comprises more than 40% of all government funding , and these costs are judged to be unsustainable . Estimates indicate AF hospitalizations cost the Canadian healthcare system $815 million, with most costs driven by poorly managed AF . In addition, projections suggest that there will be a dramatic inability to meet the future demand for healthcare traditionally provided by a physician . These fiscal and demographic realities support the need for evaluation of new models of care. Nurse practitioners (NPs) are highly trained clinicians and independent healthcare professionals who work in collaboration with other members of the healthcare team to manage a patient’s full spectrum of healthcare needs . In Alberta, “NP” is a protected title whose scope of practice is legislated pursuant to the Health Professions Act. NPs provide comprehensive health assessment, as well as diagnose, treat, and manage disease, within a holistic model of care . Each NP is accountable for determining his or her own expertise level in specific competencies and when it is appropriate to be involved or refer patients to other healthcare providers . Patients are often more satisfied with NP-led care than with physician-led care . This may be related to NPs’ spending more time engaging with patients in individualized treatment options through patient education and counseling . NP patient-centered care may improve adherence to treatment plans . NP care also may improve clinical and patient-reported outcomes as well as lead to substantive cost savings . However, despite potential advantages, there are often barriers to broad adoption of NP-led care in many environments . To the best of our knowledge, there has been one only randomized controlled trial (RCT) to date involving assessment of nurse-led care vs. standard physician care for patients with AF. Researchers at a Dutch outpatient hospital clinic randomized 714 patients with AF into 2 equal groups for 2 years . The control arm included a 20-minute initial cardiologist consult and 10-minute follow-up appointment as required. The intervention arm comprised an initial consultation in the nurse-led clinic with diagnostic testing completed prior to the visit. Treatment was guided by AF-specific decision support software. At the end of the consult, a cardiologist would review the patient and care plan. Follow-up visits were held at 3, 6, and 12 months and then every 6 months thereafter. The primary endpoint, a composite of cardiovascular hospitalization and cardiovascular death, occurred in 14.3% in the nurse-led care group compared with 20.8% in the usual care group (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.45–0.93, p = 0.017). Cardiovascular death occurred in 1.1% of the nurse-led care group vs. 3.9% in the usual care group (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09–0.85, p = 0.025). Cardiovascular hospitalization occurred in the 13.5% in the nurse-led care group vs. 19.1% in the usual care group (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46–0.96, p = 0.029). Adherence to clinical guidelines was significantly higher in the nurse-led care group. The researchers concluded that nurse-led care for patients with AF was superior to usual care provided by a cardiologist in this setting. Some important limitations of the study were that complex patients were excluded from participating, and a cardiologist was still required to review the patient’s care. Important remaining questions include whether other outcomes are improved, such as health-related quality of life (HRQoL), the patient’s perception of the quality of care received, and whether a more independent practitioner such as an NP would achieve similar results in patients. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of NP-led care on the HRQoL of adult patients with AF.We hypothesize ambulatory patients with AF whose care is managed by an NP will have improved HRQoL as measured by Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy of life Survey (AFEQT) scores compared with patients receiving standard care. We propose a prospective RCT with two equal groups testing for superiority ( see Fig. 1 ). The RCT will be conducted in the Cardiac Ensuring Accessed and Speedy Evaluation (EASE) Clinic, a multidisciplinary general cardiology outpatient referral clinic in a large tertiary care hospital in Alberta . The clinic’s normal practice is for patients to be triaged by registered nurses (RNs) who follow algorithms based on American Heart Association and Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) guidelines. Diagnostic testing is completed prior to the initial clinic visit to decrease time to follow-up. Patients are assessed in the clinic either (1) by an RN or a doctor of pharmacy and a cardiologist or (2) solely by an NP. Follow-up, if required, is either in the cardiologist’s own clinic or the NP clinic. Patients who do not require follow-up will be returned to their family physician’s care. The hospital uses an electronic medical record that incorporates scheduling of diagnostic testing, clinic appointments, and communications (letters, patient’s health history). In the context of this study proposal, standard care refers to regular clinic processes as described above. Fig. 1 Patient flow diagram.

AFEQT Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy of life survey, EASE Ensuring Accessed and Speedy Evaluation, ER Emergency room, GP General practitioner, NP Nurse practitioner, RN Registered nurse All adult patients who are referred for assessment for AF to the EASE clinic will be asked to participate in the study. Inclusion criteria are patients aged 18 years or older, with documented AF, able to provide informed consent, and able and willing to complete the study questionnaires on their own or with assistance. Exclusion criteria are patients referred for atrioventricular node ablation or pulmonary vein isolation, patients who have failed rate control or antiarrhythmic medications, or patients who have moderate to severe mitral or aortic valvular heart disease. Patients with unstable AF or who cannot or are unwilling to attend follow-up appointments are also excluded. Study criteria will be reviewed with Cardiac EASE RNs on an ongoing basis to assist with study recruitment. After verbal consent is obtained during the telephone triage call, the RN will randomize patients on a secure website. Block randomization (using variable block sizes) will be used to ensure there are equal participants in the intervention and control groups and to further conceal allocation. The patient will be scheduled in the determined clinic within 4–6 weeks from the date of referral, consistent with CCS guidelines. Prior to the initial clinic visit, written consent will be obtained by a research assistant along with the baseline questionnaires. Questionnaires will also be completed at 3- and 6-month in-person follow-up appointments. Patients who are not being seen in follow-up will have the questionnaire mailed to them. Patients will receive telephone reminders in 2 and 4 weeks if the questionnaires have not been returned. The intervention group will receive NP-led care. The initial visit is with an experienced NP with extra training in AF management. A complete baseline history and physical examination will be completed to determine a plan of care based on current CCS AF guidelines. CHADS 2 /CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score will be calculated to identify the risk of stroke for each patient. To assist with determining risk for increased potential for bleeding, the HAS-BLED score will be calculated. Canadian Cardiovascular Society Severity in Atrial Fibrillation Scale scores will also be calculated to identify symptom severity of AF. A cardiologist will be consulted if the patient develops heart failure; medication intolerances (which limit medical management) requiring assessment for treatment with amiodarone, electrical cardioversion, or pulmonary vein isolation; or other serious complications. The NP will also provide individualized patient education (“What is AF?,” “AF management and complications”). Patients will be given a written treatment plan at the end of the consult to assist with patient compliance, self-management, and knowledge retention. Patients will also be provided with clinic contact information for future needs. The NP will see the patient in follow-up at 3 and 6 months; however, if the patient’s condition requires closer follow-up, timing will be adjusted and documented. The patient’s history will be reviewed to determine if the patient has been hospitalized or has had any major adverse cardiovascular events. A provincial electronic medical record will also be reviewed for prescribed medications, dates of hospitalizations and emergency room visits, laboratory blood work results (e.g., international normalized ratio, troponin, brain natriuretic peptide, hemoglobin), and diagnostic tests (echocardiograms, chest x-rays, medical consultations, computed tomographic scans, and 12-lead electrocardiogram tracings). The control group will receive standard care by a cardiologist in the EASE Clinic. The cardiologist will determine AF management and follow-up requirements as per their usual practice. The patient’s care will be referred back to the family physician if no follow-up is required. The schedule of enrolment, intervention, and assessments of the complete study protocol (according to Additional file 1 : Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials checklist) is shown in Fig. 2 .

AFEQT Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy of life survey, CV Cardiovascular Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) diagram. AFEQT Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy of life survey, CV Cardiovascular The primary outcome is the difference in change in AFEQT scores from baseline to 3 months and 6 months between the intervention and control groups. AFEQT is an AF-specific questionnaire for use with patients with any type of AF. AFEQT is a simple survey with 20 questions based on a 7-point Likert scale covering 3 domains. The questionnaire should take about 5 minutes to complete. Four questions assess AF-related symptoms, eight questions evaluate daily functioning, and six questions evaluate AF treatment concerns. Two questions assessing satisfaction with treatment are not included in the overall score. Questions 1–18 are included in the overall scoring of the questionnaire. A score of zero corresponds to complete disability, whereas a score of 100 corresponds to no disability. The AFEQT has been shown to have good reliability, test-retest reliability, construct validity, and responsiveness as well as discriminatory properties between clinically different groups . The lowest global score is associated with the patients with severe symptoms related to AF. The AFEQT has also been shown to be responsive to change . Difference in change in EQ-5D from baseline to 6 months between intervention and control groups : The EQ-5D is a simple five-question general QoL questionnaire. It assesses five dimensions of QoL: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. It also has a visual analogue scale on which patients self-rate their overall health. A utility of 1 represents full health, whereas a utility of zero represents a state equivalent to death . Difference in composite outcomes of death from cardiovascular causes, cardiovascular hospitalization, and emergency room visits between the intervention and control groups (for ischemic stroke, heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, systemic embolism, major bleeding, severe arrhythmic events, and life-threatening adverse effects of drugs) : MSM will chair a blinded committee to determine this outcome. Satisfaction with healthcare provider care will be assessed as measured by the overall mean score of the Consultation Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) completed at the 6-month follow-up visit : The CSQ is a self-administered tool with 18 questions using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree . Three factors are considered: (a) professional aspects of the consultation, (b) depth of patient relationship, and (c) perceived length of consultation. There are three questions related to overall general satisfaction. Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction.

There are three questions related to overall general satisfaction. Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction. A minimally important difference (MID) for change in AFEQT score was not identified in a review of the literature. In the initial validation study , the SD for change from baseline to 3 months in the medically managed group was 20.0 (overall AFEQT global score). This group is most like the projected population for this study, and that value was therefore used as the SD for sample size calculations. We consulted Dr. Paul Dorian, an experienced arrhythmia specialist, AF QoL researcher, and coauthor of the AFEQT questionnaire, who suggested that the MID for AFEQT is 12. As such, we chose an effect size of 12 (i.e., NP-led care would improve AFEQT scores by at least 12). A sample size of 64 participants in each group will detect an MID of 12 in AFEQT scores (SD 20, two-tailed t test, 80% power, and significance level of 5%). Seventy patients per group (total 140) will be recruited to allow for 10% loss to follow-up. All sociodemographic and clinical characteristics for the intervention (NP-led care) and control groups at baseline will be summarized using mean ± SD for continuous variables and the observed counts and percentages for categorical variables. For the main outcome, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to assess change in AFEQT scores over time: baseline to 3 months and 3 months to 6 months (repeated dependent measures) in both the intervention and control groups. ANCOVA assumes normal distribution of the data as well as homogeneity of variance and the groups being balanced. Adjustment for pretest scores will identify whether the postintervention difference in scores is truly a result of the intervention. ANCOVA will also account for variation around the posttest means that comes from the variation attributed to the patients AFEQT scores started at baseline. Previously, it has been shown with other HRQoL scores that data can be skewed because of ceiling or floor effects resulting from extreme values and unequal distances between values on ordinal scales . However, the central limit theorem states that the means will be normally distributed regardless of the original distribution when there are at least 30 per group . This study is projected to have 2 equal groups with 70 participants. If the initial data analysis reveals nonnormal distributions and skewed data, further analysis will be completed to determine if transformation of the data is required or if other statistical analysis would be more appropriate. An independent t test will be used to assess the difference in means between NP care and physician-led care. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis will be used to evaluate the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death and hospitalizations determined by blinded assessors. Multivariate analysis will be used to adjust for possible differences in baseline characteristics and scores for any significant variables. Consultant satisfaction will be determined by comparing the means with independent t tests. A p value less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. Missing data will be replaced with the overall mean of the missing variable. This technique is known to accurately identify the mean but will underestimate the SD, making the CI overly optimistic ; however, other options also have imperfections. This will need to be considered in the final analysis. All analyses will be performed with the latest version of IBM SPSS statistical software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Data entry will be completed in a mature, secure web application specifically developed for surveys and databases. An application has been specifically designed for this study with limits built into data entry fields to limit errors. Data entry will be completed by MJS with random data entry checks done by a specific Epidemiology Coordinating and Research (EPICORE) Centre staff member. The final dataset will be available only to MJS and a specific EPICORE Centre staff member. We did not feel that a data monitoring committee was needed for the following reasons. First, the NP intervention is already part of how care is delivered at our institution. We are simply evaluating it. Second, because this is a trial of a treatment approach, we did not feel that data monitoring would be necessary (and our research ethics board did not require it). This research protocol has been approved by the health research ethics board at the University of Alberta. The patients will be required to read and understand the clinical trial information sheet and provide consent to participate. All patient information and study questionnaires will be treated with confidentiality and locked in a secure data storage facility at the EPICORE Centre ( www.epicore.ualberta.ca ). All information will be de-identified to maintain confidentiality. Modifications to any part of the study protocol will be resubmitted to the health research ethics board at the University of Alberta. Participants will be notified if applicable.We propose a prospective RCT with two equal groups testing for superiority ( see Fig. 1 ). The RCT will be conducted in the Cardiac Ensuring Accessed and Speedy Evaluation (EASE) Clinic, a multidisciplinary general cardiology outpatient referral clinic in a large tertiary care hospital in Alberta . The clinic’s normal practice is for patients to be triaged by registered nurses (RNs) who follow algorithms based on American Heart Association and Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) guidelines. Diagnostic testing is completed prior to the initial clinic visit to decrease time to follow-up. Patients are assessed in the clinic either (1) by an RN or a doctor of pharmacy and a cardiologist or (2) solely by an NP. Follow-up, if required, is either in the cardiologist’s own clinic or the NP clinic. Patients who do not require follow-up will be returned to their family physician’s care. The hospital uses an electronic medical record that incorporates scheduling of diagnostic testing, clinic appointments, and communications (letters, patient’s health history). In the context of this study proposal, standard care refers to regular clinic processes as described above. Fig. 1 Patient flow diagram.

AFEQT Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy of life survey, EASE Ensuring Accessed and Speedy Evaluation, ER Emergency room, GP General practitioner, NP Nurse practitioner, RN Registered nurseAll adult patients who are referred for assessment for AF to the EASE clinic will be asked to participate in the study. Inclusion criteria are patients aged 18 years or older, with documented AF, able to provide informed consent, and able and willing to complete the study questionnaires on their own or with assistance. Exclusion criteria are patients referred for atrioventricular node ablation or pulmonary vein isolation, patients who have failed rate control or antiarrhythmic medications, or patients who have moderate to severe mitral or aortic valvular heart disease. Patients with unstable AF or who cannot or are unwilling to attend follow-up appointments are also excluded. Study criteria will be reviewed with Cardiac EASE RNs on an ongoing basis to assist with study recruitment. After verbal consent is obtained during the telephone triage call, the RN will randomize patients on a secure website. Block randomization (using variable block sizes) will be used to ensure there are equal participants in the intervention and control groups and to further conceal allocation. The patient will be scheduled in the determined clinic within 4–6 weeks from the date of referral, consistent with CCS guidelines. Prior to the initial clinic visit, written consent will be obtained by a research assistant along with the baseline questionnaires. Questionnaires will also be completed at 3- and 6-month in-person follow-up appointments. Patients who are not being seen in follow-up will have the questionnaire mailed to them. Patients will receive telephone reminders in 2 and 4 weeks if the questionnaires have not been returned.The intervention group will receive NP-led care. The initial visit is with an experienced NP with extra training in AF management. A complete baseline history and physical examination will be completed to determine a plan of care based on current CCS AF guidelines. CHADS 2 /CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score will be calculated to identify the risk of stroke for each patient. To assist with determining risk for increased potential for bleeding, the HAS-BLED score will be calculated. Canadian Cardiovascular Society Severity in Atrial Fibrillation Scale scores will also be calculated to identify symptom severity of AF. A cardiologist will be consulted if the patient develops heart failure; medication intolerances (which limit medical management) requiring assessment for treatment with amiodarone, electrical cardioversion, or pulmonary vein isolation; or other serious complications. The NP will also provide individualized patient education (“What is AF?,” “AF management and complications”). Patients will be given a written treatment plan at the end of the consult to assist with patient compliance, self-management, and knowledge retention. Patients will also be provided with clinic contact information for future needs. The NP will see the patient in follow-up at 3 and 6 months; however, if the patient’s condition requires closer follow-up, timing will be adjusted and documented. The patient’s history will be reviewed to determine if the patient has been hospitalized or has had any major adverse cardiovascular events. A provincial electronic medical record will also be reviewed for prescribed medications, dates of hospitalizations and emergency room visits, laboratory blood work results (e.g., international normalized ratio, troponin, brain natriuretic peptide, hemoglobin), and diagnostic tests (echocardiograms, chest x-rays, medical consultations, computed tomographic scans, and 12-lead electrocardiogram tracings). The control group will receive standard care by a cardiologist in the EASE Clinic. The cardiologist will determine AF management and follow-up requirements as per their usual practice. The patient’s care will be referred back to the family physician if no follow-up is required.

Modifications to any part of the study protocol will be resubmitted to the health research ethics board at the University of Alberta. Participants will be notified if applicable.Currently, there is little evidence identifying a model of care that is sustainable and improves the QoL of patients with AF. There are several known benefits of NP-led care for other chronic disease states , and it is therefore reasonable to assume similar benefits could be attained with NP-led care for patients with AF. NPs are independent practitioners working collaboratively with physicians, and therefore the potential exists to decrease wait times for patients to be seen. This is extremely important for stroke risk assessment, to reevaluate patients with increasing symptoms to adjust medication regimes, or to arrange for interventions such as cardioversion or cardiac electrophysiology interventions. Both interventions have the potential to make a strong impact on patient outcomes as well as on the healthcare system, limiting emergency room visits and hospital admissions. Earlier appropriate management should also produce fewer devastating, costly complications of stroke and heart failure. Some Canadian centers already use RNs or NPs in their clinic, but without complete evidence of their effectiveness. Our proposed trial will help by evaluating a framework of care and determining its impact on HRQoL. We have chosen to conduct a superiority RCT design instead of a noninferiority design because we feel that NP care may offer some important patient-focused advantages over usual physician-based care. The primary outcome is a patient-important outcome rather than a clinical outcome. (Had we wished to evaluate clinical outcomes, we agree that it would have been reasonable to design a noninferiority trial of NP-led care vs. standard care.) NP-led care, as alluded to earlier, has consistently been shown to be rated higher in patient satisfaction. This may in part be due to the holistic model of care followed by NPs. It engages patients in their healthcare plans and addresses other psychosocial areas that may have an impact on their health. Ultimately, this may have an impact on their HRQoL, the primary outcome for this study. The control group will receive usual care. In our case, patients are seen by a general cardiologist, and the details of the intervention and follow-up are left to the individual cardiologist. We make no attempt to protocolize this; it is truly usual care, and we feel that it is generalizable to the Canadian setting. This research study is supported by the Cardiovascular Heath and Stroke Strategic Clinical Network, which is a network of professionals working toward better quality and outcomes for cardiovascular health in Alberta. Results will be presented at conferences and published in journals appropriate for research on AF and on NP roles. Plans will also be made to share findings with Alberta healthcare leaders and staff to support change in clinical practice if NP-led care is shown to be beneficial.

Atrial flutter, another arrhythmia, occurs less often with an incidence of approximately 200,000 new patients per year in the USA. Patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have an increased risk of death and morbidities. The management of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter is often based on interventions aiming at either a rhythm control strategy or a rate control strategy. The evidence on the comparable effects of these strategies is unclear. This protocol for a systematic review aims at identifying the best overall treatment strategy for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. This protocol for a systematic review was performed following the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration and the eight-step assessment procedure suggested by Jakobsen and colleagues. We plan to include all relevant randomised clinical trials assessing the effects of any rhythm control strategy versus any rate control strategy. We plan to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded on Web of Science, and BIOSIS to identify relevant trials. Any eligible trial will be assessed and classified as either high risk of bias or low risk of bias, and our conclusions will be based on trials with low risk of bias. The analyses of the extracted data will be performed using Review Manager 5 and Trial Sequential Analysis. For both our primary and secondary outcomes, we will create a ‘Summary of Findings’ table and use GRADE assessment to assess the quality of the evidence. The results of this systematic review have the potential to benefit thousands of patients worldwide as well as healthcare systems and healthcare economy.

       "  'article_text': 'Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia of the heart with a prevalence of approximately 2% in the western world . Atrial flutter, another arrhythmia, occurs less often with an incidence of approximately 200,000 new patients per year in the USA . The prevalence of both atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are increasing possibly because of a greater life expectancy in the general population, an increased prevalence of risk factors for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, and an improved ability to suspect and diagnose the arrhythmias . Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are associated with an increased risk of death and morbidities . The risks of both cerebral stroke and heart failure are increased nearly fivefold in patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, and an estimated 20% of every stroke may be due to atrial fibrillation . Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter also have a significant impact on healthcare costs and account for approximately 1% of the National Health Service budget in the UK and approximately 26 billion dollars of annual expenses in the USA . The atriums of the heart receive blood returning from the body and pump it further ahead to the ventricles. Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are defined as abnormal heart rhythms that arise from improper electrical activity of the heart which lead to ineffective mechanical contraction . The ineffective mechanical contraction stresses the muscle cells of the heart which over time may cause heart failure . Persistent rapid rates can also cause or worsen a tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy . Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter can be asymptomatic or lead to symptoms such as palpitations, dyspnoea, and dizziness . Atrial fibrillation may be diagnosed using an electrocardiogram as (1) irregular R-R intervals (when atrioventricular conduction is present), (2) absence of distinct repeating P -waves, and/or (3) irregular atrial activity . Atrial flutter may be diagnosed using an electrocardiogram as characteristic flutter waves ( F -waves) at a regular atrial rate of 250 to 350 beats per minute. The flutter waves may resemble P -waves or have a ‘saw-tooth’ shape . Atrial fibrillation may either be non-valvular or valvular, where the latter form is characterised by rheumatic mitral stenosis, mechanical heart valve, tissue heart valve, or mitral valve repair . However, the definition of the terms non-valvular and valvular lacks consistency in both trials and guidelines . A paper has proposed a new term ‘mechanical and rheumatic mitral valvular atrial fibrillation’, as they report that only mechanical valves and mitral stenosis have special needs in regard to antithrombotic treatment . The development of atrial fibrillation is associated with various risk factors, e.g. ageing, obesity, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and other cardiac diseases (valvular or other structural heart diseases) . The development of atrial flutter is presumably associated with prolonged PR interval and some of the same risk factors as atrial fibrillation . However, it has not been demonstrated that atrial flutter is associated with either obesity, diabetes, hypertension, or valvular heart disease . Both atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter may also occur in patients with no risk factors (so called lone atrial fibrillation or lone atrial flutter) . Based on the duration of the arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation may be divided into five different forms : Recent-onset atrial fibrillation Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation Persistent atrial fibrillation Long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation Permanent atrial fibrillation Recent-onset atrial fibrillation Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation Persistent atrial fibrillation Long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation Permanent atrial fibrillation Based on the re-entrant circuit, atrial flutter may be divided into two different forms: Typical atrial flutter is a macro-reentrant atrial tachycardia that can be subdivided based on the rotation of the circuit to counterclockwise atrial flutter (90% of patients) or clockwise atrial flutter (10% of patients) . Atypical atrial flutter is defined as any atrial tachycardia with an ECG pattern of continuous undulation of the atrial complex, different from typical atrial flutter, at a rate of ≥240 beats per minute . Typical atrial flutter is a macro-reentrant atrial tachycardia that can be subdivided based on the rotation of the circuit to counterclockwise atrial flutter (90% of patients) or clockwise atrial flutter (10% of patients) . Atypical atrial flutter is defined as any atrial tachycardia with an ECG pattern of continuous undulation of the atrial complex, different from typical atrial flutter, at a rate of ≥240 beats per minute . The pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation is thought to be an interaction between a trigger for initiation and an abnormal tissue substrate for maintenance . The trigger for initiation is often a rapidly firing focus most often located in the left atrium and the proximal parts of the pulmonary veins . The abnormal tissue substrate for maintenance is often a result of an underlying heart disease like coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathies, or heart failure . The pathogenesis of the abnormal tissue substrate is induced by inflammation , fibrosis , or hypertrophy . Electric remodelling, such as refractory period shortening, occurs after a period of continuous atrial fibrillation that further facilitate atrial fibrillation, i.e. atrial fibrillation leads to atrial fibrillation . Nevertheless, the electric remodelling is often reversible if sinus rhythm is restored, though it can become permanent if atrial fibrillation persists . Atrial flutter is classified as a macro-reentrant tachycardia. The macro-reentrant tachycardia occurs when an electrical impulse recurrently moves in a self-perpetuating circuit within the heart, rather than moving from one end of the heart to the other and terminating . As mentioned in the ‘ Background ’ section, the risk of stroke is increased nearly fivefold in patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter . Antithrombotic treatment is necessary to reduce the risk of stroke in high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, regardless of the management strategy . The risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter can be estimated by the CHA2DS2-VASc score , while the risk of bleeding can be estimated by the HAS-BLED score . Combined, these may help the physician determine the patient’s need for antithrombotic treatment . Antithrombotic drugs aim at reducing the formation of thrombi by affecting different clotting processes. Depending on the mechanism, the drugs are divided into either anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs. The classification, mechanism, and examples of anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs are summarised in Table 1 . The comparative efficacy and safety between anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs has been assessed. Two systematic reviews have shown that both warfarin and apixaban are superior to antiplatelet drugs for preventing stroke, with a similar rate of major bleeding and intracranial haemorrhage . The comparative efficacy and safety between warfarin and non-vitamin K-dependent antagonist has been assessed. Ruff et al. showed in a systematic review that the non-vitamin K-dependent antagonists compared with warfarin significantly reduced the risk of all-cause mortality by 10%, stroke by 19%, and intracranial haemorrhage by 52%. However, the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was increased by 25% by the non-vitamin K-dependent antagonists .The atriums of the heart receive blood returning from the body and pump it further ahead to the ventricles.

However, the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was increased by 25% by the non-vitamin K-dependent antagonists .Two different overall intervention strategies may be used for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter—a rhythm control strategy and a rate control strategy . The overall aims of a rhythm control strategy and a rate control strategy differ. A rhythm control strategy aims at obtaining and maintaining sinus rhythm, while a rate control strategy is an overall term for a strategy where the short- and long-term aim is to lower the ventricular frequency . Patients that receive rhythm control will often need some kind of rate control until they have obtained sinus rhythm. The interventions used for both rhythm- and rate control strategies encompass both drugs and ablation. In addition, electrical cardioversion is also used for rhythm control. The drugs used in both a rhythm control strategy and a rate control strategy are classified according to two different classifications: the Vaughan Williams classification and the Sicilian Gambit classification. The Vaughan Williams classification classifies the drugs in five different classes according to their general effect. Class I and III drugs are mainly used for a rhythm control strategy; class II and IV drugs are mainly used for a rate control strategy; and class V drugs are used for both strategies . The Vaughan Williams classification is summarised in Table 2 . The Sicilian Gambit classification places a greater approach on the underlying mechanism of the drugs and classifies each drug according to the effects on bio-cellular channels, receptors, and pumps. We will not describe this classification in detail but refer to the work by the European Society of Cardiology . The Vaughan Williams classification classifies the drugs in five different classes according to their general effect. Class I and III drugs are mainly used for a rhythm control strategy; class II and IV drugs are mainly used for a rate control strategy; and class V drugs are used for both strategies . The Vaughan Williams classification is summarised in Table 2 . The Sicilian Gambit classification places a greater approach on the underlying mechanism of the drugs and classifies each drug according to the effects on bio-cellular channels, receptors, and pumps. We will not describe this classification in detail but refer to the work by the European Society of Cardiology . We will in this systematic review use the Vaughan Williams classification which is the most commonly used classification. A rhythm control strategy typically uses medical rhythm control or electrical cardioversion as the main rhythm control intervention. If they do not work, catheter ablation or surgical ablation may be considered . Medical rhythm control involves antiarrhythmic drugs and is used for either (1) cardioversion of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter to sinus rhythm or (2) maintenance of sinus rhythm . The main drugs used for medical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are flecainide (class Ic), propafenone (class Ic), dofetilide (class III), and amiodarone (class III) . A systematic review showed that intravenous vernakalant (class III), intravenous propafenone (class Ic), and both oral and intravenous flecainide (class Ic) seemed to be significantly more effective than placebo at restoring sinus rhythm within 2 h of administration in recent-onset atrial fibrillation . When they analysed for successful cardioversion within 8–24 h, oral amiodarone (class III), oral flecainide (Ic), and both oral and intravenous propafenone (class Ic) seemed to be significantly more effective than placebo . The main drugs used for maintenance of sinus rhythm are amiodarone (class III), dofetilide (class III), dronedarone (class III), flecainide (class Ic), propafenone (class Ic), beta blockers (class II), and sotalol (class III) . Lafuente-Lafuente et al. showed in a Cochrane review that drugs belonging to class Ia (disopyramide and quinidine), class Ic (flecainide and propafenone), class II (metoprolol), and class III (amiodarone, dofetilide, dronedarone, and sotalol) were moderately effective in maintaining sinus rhythm compared with patients not receiving antiarrhythmic drugs (56). Nonetheless, all drugs were associated with adverse events, including proarrhythmia (new or more frequent occurrence of pre-existing arrhythmias) . Treatment with quinidine (class Ia), disopyramide (class Ia), or sotalol (class III) compared with not receiving antiarrhythmic drugs was associated with higher risks of all-cause mortality and serious adverse events . In regard to class Ic drugs (flecainide and propafenone), no increased risk of mortality was found. However, as the data obtained on mortality with flecainide (class Ic) and propafenone (class Ic) seemed sparse, the authors concluded that the result was uncertain . Guidelines recommend that flecainide (class Ic) and propafenone (class Ic) should only be used in patients without ischaemic heart disease or heart failure . This is based on a randomised trial from 1989, the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST), that compared antiarrhythmic drug therapy with placebo in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic ventricular arrhythmia (six or more ventricular premature beats per hour) after myocardial infarction . The trial showed an increased risk of mortality and sudden cardiac death caused by ventricular arrhythmias in the patients receiving encainide (class Ic) and flecainide (class Ic) compared with placebo . In several systematic reviews, amiodarone (class III) was shown to be better than class I (flecainide, propafenone, disopyramide, and quinidine) and other class III drugs (sotalol, dofetilide, and dronedarone) at maintaining sinus rhythm . However, in one systematic review, amiodarone (class III) was shown to induce a higher number of adverse events . Electrical cardioversion is a non-invasive procedure that uses electrical shock to convert atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (or other arrhythmias) into sinus rhythm . Current evidence supports the use of electrical cardioversion with biphasic waveforms with an intensity of 200 J for atrial fibrillation, as the proportion of success is 91 to 94% . The monophasic waveform requires intensity up to 360 J to work, and the proportion of success is 79 to 85% . For atrial flutter, evidence supports the use of biphasic waveforms with an intensity of 50 to 100 J . It has been shown that longer duration of atrial fibrillation was inversely associated with cardioversion proportions . To enhance the effectiveness of the procedure, antiarrhythmic drugs, such as amiodarone (class III), flecainide (class Ic), ibutilide (class Ic), propafenone (class Ic), and sotalol (class III), can be used . Two different ablation procedures may be used for rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter—catheter ablation or surgical ablation. Both procedures do not involve controlling the heart rate but aim at obtaining sinus rhythm. Catheter ablation may be indicated in patients with paroxysmal, persistent, or long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter that is refractory or intolerant to medical rhythm control . Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation is mostly performed in the left atrium, usually entering via the vena femoralis, vena jugularis interna, or vena subclavia. In the left atrium, a series of lesions are created, and the lesions are thought either to eliminate possible triggers originating from the pulmonary veins or to modify the substrate that maintains the atrial fibrillation . Catheter ablation may also be indicated in patients with typical atrial flutter where the lesions caused by catheter ablation are thought to interrupt the macro-reentrant circuit maintaining the atrial flutter . The main technique for either atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter is radiofrequency ablation that achieves myocardial necrosis through tissue heating . In an observational study, the risk of major complications (e.g. death, tamponade, total femoral pseudoaneurysm, or transient ischemic attack) after catheter ablation was found to be 4.5% based on 20,825 procedures . Surgical ablation is performed doing a Cox-Maze procedure by open-heart surgery or a less-invasive right mini thoracotomy . A Cox-Maze procedure is done by creating a number of surgical lesions in the left and right atrium in order to form scar tissue. The scar tissue inhibits the conduction of electricity, consequently disrupting the abnormal electrical impulses . The procedure is most often done concomitantly with other cardiac surgery than as a lone procedure . A randomised clinical trial compared surgical ablation with no surgical ablation during mitral-valve surgery and showed significantly higher conversion rates in the surgical ablation group . The risk of mortality was similar to both groups. However, there was a significantly higher rate of permanent pacemaker implantation in the surgical ablation group than in the no surgical ablation group . The drugs used for rate control in atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are mainly beta blockers (class II), non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (class IV), and digoxin (class V) . All three types of drugs work by lowering the heart rate which might consequently prevent excessive tachycardia and limit symptoms. Lowering the heart rate might theoretically prevent the development of heart failure and tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy . An observational study compared rate control with no rate control and showed lower risk of mortality in the patients receiving beta blockers (class II) or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (class IV). In contrast, the patients receiving digoxin (class V) seemed to have a higher risk of mortality . A systematic review compared rate control interventions with placebo and showed that selective beta blockers (class II), verapamil (class IV), diltiazem (class IV), and partial digoxin (class V) were better than placebo at lowering the heart rate . According to guidelines, beta blockers (class II) or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (class IV) are first-line therapy, while digoxin (class V) may be combined with one of them if they alone are insufficient to control the heart rate . The Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) trial showed that beta-blockers (class II) (with or without digoxin (class V)) achieved rate control (rest ≤80 beats/min) in 70% of the patients compared with 54% for non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (class IV) (with or without digoxin (class V)) and 58% for digoxin (class V) (used without beta-blockers (class II) or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (class IV)) . Amiodarone (class III) may also control the heart rate, as it exhibits beta and calcium channel blockade in addition to its antiarrhythmic activity. However, amiodarone (class III) has extensive non-cardiac adverse events and is only used if other rate control drugs are not effective enough, not well tolerated, or contraindicated . According to guidelines, physicians should consider the patient’s degree of symptoms, haemodynamic status, presence or absence of heart failure, and comorbidities when choosing which rate control intervention to use . During recent years, observational studies have compared digoxin versus no digoxin in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter and showed conflicting results . Some studies have shown that digoxin seemed to increase the risk of all-cause mortality regardless of concomitant heart failure , while others did not show any difference between the compared groups . Nonetheless, guidelines recommend using digoxin as the primary drug for rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter who have concomitant heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. Digoxin is also recommended for acute rate control in patients with preserved ejection fraction . Atrioventricular node ablation procedure is a rare but highly effective procedure that controls the ventricular heart rate with the help of a pacemaker . The procedure is done by ablation of the atrioventricular node via assess from vena femoralis dexter, consequently cancelling all electrical impulses from the atriums to the ventricles. Hence, the procedure induces complete atrioventricular block and permanent pacing is necessary . The procedure does not involve rhythm control, and atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter is still present after the procedure. The atrioventricular node ablation procedure primarily benefits patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter who have symptoms refractory to medical rate control .A rhythm control strategy typically uses medical rhythm control or electrical cardioversion as the main rhythm control intervention. If they do not work, catheter ablation or surgical ablation may be considered .Medical rhythm control involves antiarrhythmic drugs and is used for either (1) cardioversion of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter to sinus rhythm or (2) maintenance of sinus rhythm . The main drugs used for medical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are flecainide (class Ic), propafenone (class Ic), dofetilide (class III), and amiodarone (class III) .

When they analysed for successful cardioversion within 8–24 h, oral amiodarone (class III), oral flecainide (Ic), and both oral and intravenous propafenone (class Ic) seemed to be significantly more effective than placebo . The main drugs used for maintenance of sinus rhythm are amiodarone (class III), dofetilide (class III), dronedarone (class III), flecainide (class Ic), propafenone (class Ic), beta blockers (class II), and sotalol (class III) .

For atrial flutter, evidence supports the use of biphasic waveforms with an intensity of 50 to 100 J . It has been shown that longer duration of atrial fibrillation was inversely associated with cardioversion proportions . To enhance the effectiveness of the procedure, antiarrhythmic drugs, such as amiodarone (class III), flecainide (class Ic), ibutilide (class Ic), propafenone (class Ic), and sotalol (class III), can be used .Two different ablation procedures may be used for rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter—catheter ablation or surgical ablation.

The Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) trial showed that beta-blockers (class II) (with or without digoxin (class V)) achieved rate control (rest ≤80 beats/min) in 70% of the patients compared with 54% for non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (class IV) (with or without digoxin (class V)) and 58% for digoxin (class V) (used without beta-blockers (class II) or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (class IV)) . Amiodarone (class III) may also control the heart rate, as it exhibits beta and calcium channel blockade in addition to its antiarrhythmic activity. However, amiodarone (class III) has extensive non-cardiac adverse events and is only used if other rate control drugs are not effective enough, not well tolerated, or contraindicated . According to guidelines, physicians should consider the patient’s degree of symptoms, haemodynamic status, presence or absence of heart failure, and comorbidities when choosing which rate control intervention to use . During recent years, observational studies have compared digoxin versus no digoxin in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter and showed conflicting results . Some studies have shown that digoxin seemed to increase the risk of all-cause mortality regardless of concomitant heart failure , while others did not show any difference between the compared groups . Nonetheless, guidelines recommend using digoxin as the primary drug for rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter who have concomitant heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. Digoxin is also recommended for acute rate control in patients with preserved ejection fraction . Atrioventricular node ablation procedure is a rare but highly effective procedure that controls the ventricular heart rate with the help of a pacemaker . The procedure is done by ablation of the atrioventricular node via assess from vena femoralis dexter, consequently cancelling all electrical impulses from the atriums to the ventricles. Hence, the procedure induces complete atrioventricular block and permanent pacing is necessary . The procedure does not involve rhythm control, and atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter is still present after the procedure. The atrioventricular node ablation procedure primarily benefits patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter who have symptoms refractory to medical rate control .The drugs used for rate control in atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are mainly beta blockers (class II), non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (class IV), and digoxin (class V) . All three types of drugs work by lowering the heart rate which might consequently prevent excessive tachycardia and limit symptoms. Lowering the heart rate might theoretically prevent the development of heart failure and tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy . An observational study compared rate control with no rate control and showed lower risk of mortality in the patients receiving beta blockers (class II) or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (class IV). In contrast, the patients receiving digoxin (class V) seemed to have a higher risk of mortality . A systematic review compared rate control interventions with placebo and showed that selective beta blockers (class II), verapamil (class IV), diltiazem (class IV), and partial digoxin (class V) were better than placebo at lowering the heart rate . According to guidelines, beta blockers (class II) or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (class IV) are first-line therapy, while digoxin (class V) may be combined with one of them if they alone are insufficient to control the heart rate .

The procedure does not involve rhythm control, and atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter is still present after the procedure. The atrioventricular node ablation procedure primarily benefits patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter who have symptoms refractory to medical rate control .Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are the most common arrhythmias of the heart and are associated with an increased risk of death and morbidities . The treatment of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter is based on two overall treatment strategies—a rhythm control strategy and a rate control strategy . Several meta-analyses of randomised trials have compared rhythm control strategies with rate control strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter . Cordina et al. from 2005 included 2 trials with 4312 participants ; Caldeira et al. from 2012 included 8 trials with 7499 participants ; Chatterjee et al. from 2013 included 10 trials with 7867 participants ; and Al-Khatib et al. from 2014 included 16 trials with 7608 participants . None of the reviews showed any difference in effects of any of the strategies on all-cause death and other patient-centred clinical outcomes. However, Chatterjee et al. showed lower risk of all-cause mortality in patients younger than 65 years in the rhythm control group compared with the rate control group . Cordina et al. showed significantly higher rates of adverse events in the rhythm control group compared with the rate control group . No former review comparing rhythm control strategies with rate control strategies has taken into account both risks of systematic errors and risks of random errors (Cochrane methodology, Trial Sequential Analysis, and the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment) . Therefore, it is still unclear whether a rhythm control strategy or a rate control strategy is the best treatment strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. In the present systematic review, we will collect and present current evidence of rhythm control versus rate control for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.The objective of the study is to assess the beneficial and harmful effects of rhythm control strategies versus rate control strategies for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.This systematic review protocol has been developed based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines for reporting systematic reviews evaluating healthcare interventions . A PRISMA-P checklist file is attached (Additional file 1 ). Randomised clinical trials irrespective of trial design, setting, publication status, publication year, and language. We will not include quasi-randomised trials and observational studies for the assessments of harms. We are aware that this is a limitation of our review. Patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. We will accept the definitions used by the trialists. Patients will be included irrespective of age, sex, and comorbidities. Rhythm control group: we will accept any type of rhythm control strategy, i.e. any intervention where the overall aim is to convert the atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter to sinus rhythm. Treatment elements of the rhythm control strategy could for example be flecainide, propafenone, dofetilide, amiodarone, dronedarone, sotalol, or electrical cardioversion (all irrespective of dose, rout of administration, and duration). We will accept if the rhythm control strategy also includes rate control interventions as part of treatment, but the overall aim (short or long term) has to be to obtain sinus rhythm. Rate control group: we will accept any type of rate control strategy, i.e. any intervention where the overall aim is to control the heart rate and the focus is not to convert the atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter to sinus rhythm. Treatment elements of the rate control strategy could for example be beta blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, digoxin, or amiodarone (all irrespective of dose, route of administration, and duration). We will accept any type of co-intervention when such co-intervention is intended to be delivered similar to the rhythm control group and the rate control group. We will for all outcomes use the trial results reported at maximal follow-up. However, if the trialists report results at multiple time points, we will primarily use the results reported at the time point closest to 24 months. All-cause mortality. Serious adverse events. We will define a serious adverse event as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in death, was life-threatening, required hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, and resulted in persistent or significant disability or jeopardised the patient . Quality of life measured on any valid scale. All-cause mortality. Serious adverse events. We will define a serious adverse event as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in death, was life-threatening, required hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, and resulted in persistent or significant disability or jeopardised the patient .

We will also consider relevant for the review unpublished and grey literature trials if we identify these.We will perform the review following the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration . The analyses will be performed using Review Manager 5 and Trial Sequential Analysis . In case of Review Manager statistical software not being sufficient, we will use STATA 14 . Two authors (NJS and SS) will independently screen titles and abstracts. We will retrieve all relevant full-text study reports/publications, and two review authors (NJS and SS) will independently screen the full text and identify and record reasons for exclusion of the ineligible studies. We will resolve any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third person (JCJ). Trial selection will be displayed in an adapted flow diagram as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement . Four authors (NJS, SS, EEN, and JF) will in pairs extract data independently from included trials. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion with a fifth author (JCJ). We will assess duplicate publications and companion papers of a trial together to evaluate all available data simultaneously (maximise data extraction, correct bias assessment). We will contact the trial authors by email to specify any additional data, which may not have been reported sufficiently or at all in the publication. Bias risk components (as defined below); trial design (parallel, factorial, or crossover); number of intervention arms; length of follow-up; estimation of sample size; inclusion and exclusion criteria. Number of randomised participants; number of analysed participants; number of participants lost to follow-up/withdrawals/crossover; compliance with medication; age range (mean or median) and sex ratio; type of arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter); baseline numbers of cardiovascular risk factors (i.e. diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, or smoking); baseline number of participants with heart failure; baseline number of participants with valvular heart disease; baseline number of participants with previous myocardial infarction; baseline number of participants with previous revascularisation; and baseline number of participants with previous angina. We will additionally report the proportion of participants in the compared groups who receive electrical cardioversion, atrioventricular node ablation, catheter ablation, and surgical ablation. Type of rhythm control intervention, type of rate control intervention, dose of intervention, duration of therapy, and mode of administration. Type of rate control intervention, dose of intervention, duration of therapy, and mode of administration. Type of co-intervention; dose of co-intervention; duration of co-intervention; and mode of administration. All outcomes listed above will be extracted from each randomised clinical trial, and we will identify if outcomes are incomplete or selectively reported according to the criteria described later in ‘incomplete outcome data’ bias domain and ‘selective outcome reporting’ bias domain. Funding of the trial and notable conflicts of interest of trial authors will be extracted, if available. We will note in the ‘Characteristics of included studies’ table if outcome data were not reported in a usable way. Two review authors (NJS and SS) will independently transfer data into the Review Manager file . Disagreements will be resolved through discussion or, if required, we will consult with a third author (JCJ). We will use the instructions given in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions in our evaluation of the methodology and hence the risk of bias of the included trials. We will evaluate the methodology in respect of: Random sequence generation Allocation concealment Blinding of participants and treatment providers Blinding of outcome assessment Incomplete outcome data Selective outcome reporting Other risks of bias Overall risk of bias Random sequence generation Allocation concealment Blinding of participants and treatment providers Blinding of outcome assessment Incomplete outcome data Selective outcome reporting Other risks of bias Overall risk of bias These components enable classification of randomised trials with low risk of bias and high risk of bias. The latter trials tend to overestimate positive intervention effects and underestimate negative effects . We will classify the trials according to the following criteria. Low risk: If sequence generation was achieved using computer random number generator or a random number table. Drawing lots, tossing a coin, shuffling cards, and throwing dice were also considered adequate if performed by an independent adjudicator. Unclear risk: If the method of randomisation was not specified, but the trial was still presented as being randomised. High risk: If the allocation sequence is not randomised or only quasi-randomised. These trials will be excluded. Low risk: If sequence generation was achieved using computer random number generator or a random number table. Drawing lots, tossing a coin, shuffling cards, and throwing dice were also considered adequate if performed by an independent adjudicator. Unclear risk: If the method of randomisation was not specified, but the trial was still presented as being randomised. High risk: If the allocation sequence is not randomised or only quasi-randomised. These trials will be excluded. Low risk: If the allocation of patients was performed by a central independent unit, on-site locked computer, identical-looking numbered sealed envelopes, drug bottles, or containers prepared by an independent pharmacist or investigator. Uncertain risk: If the trial was classified as randomised but the allocation concealment process was not described. High risk: If the allocation sequence was familiar to the investigators who assigned participants. Low risk: If the allocation of patients was performed by a central independent unit, on-site locked computer, identical-looking numbered sealed envelopes, drug bottles, or containers prepared by an independent pharmacist or investigator. Uncertain risk: If the trial was classified as randomised but the allocation concealment process was not described. High risk: If the allocation sequence was familiar to the investigators who assigned participants. Low risk: If the participants and the treatment providers were blinded to intervention allocation and this was described. Uncertain risk: If the procedure of blinding was insufficiently described. High risk: If blinding of participants and the treatment providers was not performed. Low risk: If the participants and the treatment providers were blinded to intervention allocation and this was described. Uncertain risk: If the procedure of blinding was insufficiently described. High risk: If blinding of participants and the treatment providers was not performed. Low risk of bias: If it was mentioned that outcome assessors were blinded and this was described. Uncertain risk of bias: If it was not mentioned if the outcome assessors in the trial were blinded or the extent of blinding was insufficiently described. High risk of bias: If no blinding or incomplete blinding of outcome assessors was performed. Low risk of bias: If it was mentioned that outcome assessors were blinded and this was described. Uncertain risk of bias: If it was not mentioned if the outcome assessors in the trial were blinded or the extent of blinding was insufficiently described. High risk of bias: If no blinding or incomplete blinding of outcome assessors was performed. Low risk of bias: If missing data were unlikely to make treatment effects depart from plausible values. This could be either (1) there were no drop-outs or withdrawals for all outcomes or (2) the numbers and reasons for the withdrawals and drop-outs for all outcomes were clearly stated and could be described as being similar to both groups. Generally, the trial is judged as at a low risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data if drop-outs are less than 5%. However, the 5% cut-off is not definitive. Uncertain risk of bias: If there was insufficient information to assess whether missing data were likely to induce bias on the results. High risk of bias: If the results were likely to be biased due to missing data either because the pattern of drop-outs could be described as being different in the two intervention groups or the trial used improper methods in dealing with the missing data (e.g. last observation carried forward). Low risk of bias: If missing data were unlikely to make treatment effects depart from plausible values. This could be either (1) there were no drop-outs or withdrawals for all outcomes or (2) the numbers and reasons for the withdrawals and drop-outs for all outcomes were clearly stated and could be described as being similar to both groups. Generally, the trial is judged as at a low risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data if drop-outs are less than 5%. However, the 5% cut-off is not definitive. Uncertain risk of bias: If there was insufficient information to assess whether missing data were likely to induce bias on the results. High risk of bias: If the results were likely to be biased due to missing data either because the pattern of drop-outs could be described as being different in the two intervention groups or the trial used improper methods in dealing with the missing data (e.g. last observation carried forward). Low risk of bias: If a protocol was published before or at the time the trial was begun and the outcomes specified in the protocol were reported on. If there is no protocol or the protocol was published after the trial has begun, reporting of all-cause mortality and serious adverse events will grant the trial a grade of low risk of bias. Uncertain risk of bias: If no protocol was published and the outcome all-cause mortality and serious adverse events were not reported on. High risk of bias: If the outcomes in the protocol were not reported on. Low risk of bias: If a protocol was published before or at the time the trial was begun and the outcomes specified in the protocol were reported on. If there is no protocol or the protocol was published after the trial has begun, reporting of all-cause mortality and serious adverse events will grant the trial a grade of low risk of bias. Uncertain risk of bias: If no protocol was published and the outcome all-cause mortality and serious adverse events were not reported on. High risk of bias: If the outcomes in the protocol were not reported on. Low risk of bias: If the trial appears to be free of other components (for example, academic bias or for-profit bias) that could put it at risk of bias. Unclear risk of bias: If the trial may or may not be free of other components that could put it at risk of bias. High risk of bias: If there are other factors in the trial that could put it at risk of bias (for example, authors conducted trials on the same topic, for-profit bias, etc.). Low risk of bias: If the trial appears to be free of other components (for example, academic bias or for-profit bias) that could put it at risk of bias. Unclear risk of bias: If the trial may or may not be free of other components that could put it at risk of bias. High risk of bias: If there are other factors in the trial that could put it at risk of bias (for example, authors conducted trials on the same topic, for-profit bias, etc.). Low risk of bias: The trial will be classified as overall ‘low risk of bias’ only if all of the bias domains described in the above paragraphs are classified as ‘low risk of bias’. High risk of bias: The trial will be classified as ‘high risk of bias’ if any of the bias risk domains described in the above are classified as ‘unclear’ or ‘high risk of bias’. Low risk of bias: The trial will be classified as overall ‘low risk of bias’ only if all of the bias domains described in the above paragraphs are classified as ‘low risk of bias’. High risk of bias: The trial will be classified as ‘high risk of bias’ if any of the bias risk domains described in the above are classified as ‘unclear’ or ‘high risk of bias’. We will assess the domains ‘blinding of outcome assessment’, ‘incomplete outcome data’, and ‘selective outcome reporting’ for each outcome result. Thus, we can assess the bias risk for each outcome assessed in addition to each trial. Our primary conclusions will be based on the results of our primary outcome results with overall low risk of bias. Both our primary and secondary conclusions will be presented in the summary of findings tables. We will conduct the review according to this published protocol and report any deviations from it in the ‘ Differences between the protocol and the review ’ section of the systematic review. We will calculate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, as well as the Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted CIs (see below). We will calculate the mean differences (MDs) and the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes, as well as the Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted CIs (see below). We will, as first option, contact all trial authors to obtain any relevant missing data (i.e. for data extraction and for assessment of risk of bias, as specified above). We will not impute missing values for any outcomes in our primary analysis. In two of our sensitivity analyses (see paragraph below), we will impute data. We will primarily analyse scores assessed at single time points. If only changes from baseline scores are reported, we will analyse the results together with follow-up scores . If standard deviations (SDs) are not reported, we will calculate the SDs using trial data, if possible. We will not use intention-to-treat data if the original report did not contain such data. We will not impute missing values for any outcomes in our primary analysis. In our sensitivity analysis (see paragraph below) for continuous outcomes, we will impute data. We will primarily investigate forest plots to visually assess any sign of heterogeneity. We will secondly assess the presence of statistical heterogeneity by chi 2 test (threshold P < 0.10) and measure the quantities of heterogeneity by the I 2 statistic . We will follow the recommendations for threshold by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions : 0 to 40%: might not be important 30 to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity 50 to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity 75 to 100%: may represent considerable heterogeneity 0 to 40%: might not be important 30 to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity 50 to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity 75 to 100%: may represent considerable heterogeneity We will investigate possible heterogeneity through subgroup analyses. Ultimately, we may decide that a meta-analysis should be avoided . We will use a funnel plot to assess reporting bias if ten or more trials are included. We will visually inspect funnel plots to assess the risk of bias. We are aware of the limitations of a funnel plot (i.e. a funnel plot assesses bias due to small sample size). From this information, we assess possible reporting bias. For dichotomous outcomes, we will test asymmetry with the Harbord test if τ 2 is less than 0.1 and with the Rücker test if τ 2 is more than 0.1. For continuous outcomes, we will use the regression asymmetry test and the adjusted rank correlation . We will only include randomised clinical trials. For trials using crossover design, only data from the first period will be included . There will therefore not be any unit of analysis issues. We will not include cluster randomised trials. We will undertake this meta-analysis according to the recommendations stated in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions , Keus et al. , and the eight-step assessment suggested by Jakobsen et al. . We will use the statistical software Review Manager 5.3 provided by Cochrane to analyse data. We will assess our intervention effects with both random-effects meta-analyses and fixed-effects meta-analyses . We will use the more conservative point estimate of the two . The more conservative point estimate is the estimate closest to zero effect. If the two estimates are similar, we will use the estimate with the widest CI. We use three primary outcomes, and therefore, we will consider a P value of 0.025 or less as the threshold for statistical significance . We use two secondary outcomes, and therefore, we will consider a P value of 0.033 or less as threshold for statistical significance . We will investigate possible heterogeneity through subgroup analyses. Ultimately, we may decide that a meta-analysis should be avoided . We will use the eight-step procedure to assess if the thresholds for significance are crossed . Our primary conclusion will be based on results with low risk of bias . Where multiple trial arms are reported in a single trial, we will include only the relevant arms. If two comparisons are combined in the same meta-analysis, we will halve the control group to avoid double-counting . Trials with a factorial design will be included. In case of, e.g. a 2 × 2 factorial designed trial, the two groups receiving rhythm control interventions will be considered rhythm control groups, while the two groups receiving rate control interventions will be considered rate control groups. If quantitative synthesis is not appropriate, we will report the results in a narrative way. Traditional meta-analysis runs the risk of random errors due to sparse data and repetitive testing of accumulating data when updating reviews. We wish to control the risks of type I errors and type II errors. We will therefore perform Trial Sequential Analysis on the outcomes, in order to calculate the required information size (that is the number of participants needed in a meta-analysis to detect or reject a certain intervention effect) and the cumulative Z-curve’s breach of relevant trial sequential monitoring boundaries . A more detailed description of Trial Sequential Analysis can be found in the Trial Sequential Analysis manual and at http://www.ctu.dk/tsa/ . For dichotomous outcomes, we will estimate the required information size based on the observed proportion of patients with an outcome in the control group (the cumulative proportion of patients with an event in the control groups relative to all patients in the control groups), a relative risk reduction of 15%, an alpha of 2.5% for our primary outcomes and an alpha of 3.3% for our secondary outcomes, a beta of 10%, and diversity as suggested by the trials in the meta-analysis. For continuous outcomes, we will in the Trial Sequential Analysis use the observed SD, a mean difference of the observed SD/2, an alpha of 2.5% for our primary outcomes and an alpha of 3.3% for our secondary outcomes, and a beta of 10%. We will perform the following subgroup analysis when analysing the primary outcomes (all-cause mortality, serious adverse event, and quality of life). High risk of bias trials compared to low risk of bias trials Comparison of individual rhythm control interventions with any rate control intervention Comparison of individual rate control interventions with any rhythm control intervention Participants with atrial fibrillation compared to participants with atrial flutter Age of participants: 0 to 59 years, 60 to 79 years, and above 80 years Duration of atrial fibrillation: recent-onset atrial fibrillation (as defined by the trialists), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (less than 7 days of onset), persistent atrial fibrillation (more than 7 days and less than 1 year of onset), and long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (more than 1 year of onset) Duration of anticoagulation therapy: anticoagulation therapy until sinus rhythm for at least 4 weeks, anticoagulation therapy until sinus rhythm for at least 12 weeks, or anticoagulation therapy until end of follow-up Men compared to women High risk of bias trials compared to low risk of bias trials Comparison of individual rhythm control interventions with any rate control intervention Comparison of individual rate control interventions with any rhythm control intervention Participants with atrial fibrillation compared to participants with atrial flutter Age of participants: 0 to 59 years, 60 to 79 years, and above 80 years Duration of atrial fibrillation: recent-onset atrial fibrillation (as defined by the trialists), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (less than 7 days of onset), persistent atrial fibrillation (more than 7 days and less than 1 year of onset), and long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (more than 1 year of onset) Duration of anticoagulation therapy: anticoagulation therapy until sinus rhythm for at least 4 weeks, anticoagulation therapy until sinus rhythm for at least 12 weeks, or anticoagulation therapy until end of follow-up Men compared to women We will use the formal test for subgroup interactions in Review Manager . To assess the potential impact of the missing data for dichotomous outcomes, we will perform the two following sensitivity analyses on both the primary and secondary outcomes. ‘Best-worst-case’ scenario: We will assume that all participants lost to follow-up in the rhythm control group have survived, had no serious adverse event, and had no stroke and that all those participants lost to follow-up in the rate control group have not survived, had a serious adverse event, and had a stroke. ‘Worst-best-case’ scenario: We will assume that all participants lost to follow-up in the rhythm control group have not survived, had a serious adverse event, and had a stroke and that all those participants lost to follow-up in the rate control group have survived, had no serious adverse event, and had no stroke. ‘Best-worst-case’ scenario: We will assume that all participants lost to follow-up in the rhythm control group have survived, had no serious adverse event, and had no stroke and that all those participants lost to follow-up in the rate control group have not survived, had a serious adverse event, and had a stroke. ‘Worst-best-case’ scenario: We will assume that all participants lost to follow-up in the rhythm control group have not survived, had a serious adverse event, and had a stroke and that all those participants lost to follow-up in the rate control group have survived, had no serious adverse event, and had no stroke. We will present results of both scenarios in our review. When analysing quality of life or ejection fraction, a ‘beneficial outcome’ will be the group mean plus two standard deviations (SDs) (we will secondly use one SD in another sensitivity analysis) of the group mean and a ‘harmful outcome’ will be the group mean minus two SDs (we will secondly use one SD in another sensitivity analysis) of the group mean . To assess the potential impact of missing SDs for continuous outcomes, we will perform the following sensitivity analysis. Where SDs are missing and it is not possible to calculate them, we will impute SDs from trials with similar populations and low risk of bias. If we find no such trials, we will impute SDs from trials with a similar population. As the final option, we will impute SDs from all trials. Where SDs are missing and it is not possible to calculate them, we will impute SDs from trials with similar populations and low risk of bias. If we find no such trials, we will impute SDs from trials with a similar population. As the final option, we will impute SDs from all trials. We will present results of this scenario in our review. Other post hoc sensitivity analyses might be warranted if unexpected clinical or statistical heterogeneity is identified during the analysis of the review results . We will create a Summary of Findings table using each of the prespecified outcomes (all-cause mortality, serious adverse event, quality of life, stroke, and ejection fraction). We will use the five GRADE considerations (bias risk of the trials, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the quality of a body of evidence as it relates to the studies which contribute data to the meta-analyses for the prespecified outcomes . We will use methods and recommendations described in Chapter 8 (Section 8.5) and Chapter 12 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions using GRADEpro software. We will justify all decisions to downgrade the quality of studies using footnotes, and we will make comments to aid the reader’s understanding of the review where necessary. Firstly, we will present our results in the Summary of Findings table based on the results from the trials with low risk of bias, and secondly, we will present the results based on all trials.Two authors (NJS and SS) will independently screen titles and abstracts. We will retrieve all relevant full-text study reports/publications, and two review authors (NJS and SS) will independently screen the full text and identify and record reasons for exclusion of the ineligible studies. We will resolve any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third person (JCJ). Trial selection will be displayed in an adapted flow diagram as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement .Four authors (NJS, SS, EEN, and JF) will in pairs extract data independently from included trials. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion with a fifth author (JCJ). We will assess duplicate publications and companion papers of a trial together to evaluate all available data simultaneously (maximise data extraction, correct bias assessment). We will contact the trial authors by email to specify any additional data, which may not have been reported sufficiently or at all in the publication. Bias risk components (as defined below); trial design (parallel, factorial, or crossover); number of intervention arms; length of follow-up; estimation of sample size; inclusion and exclusion criteria. Number of randomised participants; number of analysed participants; number of participants lost to follow-up/withdrawals/crossover; compliance with medication; age range (mean or median) and sex ratio; type of arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter); baseline numbers of cardiovascular risk factors (i.e. diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, or smoking); baseline number of participants with heart failure; baseline number of participants with valvular heart disease; baseline number of participants with previous myocardial infarction; baseline number of participants with previous revascularisation; and baseline number of participants with previous angina. We will additionally report the proportion of participants in the compared groups who receive electrical cardioversion, atrioventricular node ablation, catheter ablation, and surgical ablation. Type of rhythm control intervention, type of rate control intervention, dose of intervention, duration of therapy, and mode of administration. Type of rate control intervention, dose of intervention, duration of therapy, and mode of administration. Type of co-intervention; dose of co-intervention; duration of co-intervention; and mode of administration. All outcomes listed above will be extracted from each randomised clinical trial, and we will identify if outcomes are incomplete or selectively reported according to the criteria described later in ‘incomplete outcome data’ bias domain and ‘selective outcome reporting’ bias domain. Funding of the trial and notable conflicts of interest of trial authors will be extracted, if available. We will note in the ‘Characteristics of included studies’ table if outcome data were not reported in a usable way. Two review authors (NJS and SS) will independently transfer data into the Review Manager file . Disagreements will be resolved through discussion or, if required, we will consult with a third author (JCJ). We will use the instructions given in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions in our evaluation of the methodology and hence the risk of bias of the included trials. We will evaluate the methodology in respect of: Random sequence generation Allocation concealment Blinding of participants and treatment providers Blinding of outcome assessment Incomplete outcome data Selective outcome reporting Other risks of bias Overall risk of bias Random sequence generation Allocation concealment Blinding of participants and treatment providers Blinding of outcome assessment Incomplete outcome data Selective outcome reporting Other risks of bias Overall risk of bias These components enable classification of randomised trials with low risk of bias and high risk of bias. The latter trials tend to overestimate positive intervention effects and underestimate negative effects . We will classify the trials according to the following criteria. Low risk: If sequence generation was achieved using computer random number generator or a random number table. Drawing lots, tossing a coin, shuffling cards, and throwing dice were also considered adequate if performed by an independent adjudicator. Unclear risk: If the method of randomisation was not specified, but the trial was still presented as being randomised. High risk: If the allocation sequence is not randomised or only quasi-randomised. These trials will be excluded. Low risk: If sequence generation was achieved using computer random number generator or a random number table. Drawing lots, tossing a coin, shuffling cards, and throwing dice were also considered adequate if performed by an independent adjudicator. Unclear risk: If the method of randomisation was not specified, but the trial was still presented as being randomised. High risk: If the allocation sequence is not randomised or only quasi-randomised. These trials will be excluded. Low risk: If the allocation of patients was performed by a central independent unit, on-site locked computer, identical-looking numbered sealed envelopes, drug bottles, or containers prepared by an independent pharmacist or investigator. Uncertain risk: If the trial was classified as randomised but the allocation concealment process was not described. High risk: If the allocation sequence was familiar to the investigators who assigned participants. Low risk: If the allocation of patients was performed by a central independent unit, on-site locked computer, identical-looking numbered sealed envelopes, drug bottles, or containers prepared by an independent pharmacist or investigator. Uncertain risk: If the trial was classified as randomised but the allocation concealment process was not described. High risk: If the allocation sequence was familiar to the investigators who assigned participants. Low risk: If the participants and the treatment providers were blinded to intervention allocation and this was described. Uncertain risk: If the procedure of blinding was insufficiently described. High risk: If blinding of participants and the treatment providers was not performed. Low risk: If the participants and the treatment providers were blinded to intervention allocation and this was described. Uncertain risk: If the procedure of blinding was insufficiently described. High risk: If blinding of participants and the treatment providers was not performed. Low risk of bias: If it was mentioned that outcome assessors were blinded and this was described. Uncertain risk of bias: If it was not mentioned if the outcome assessors in the trial were blinded or the extent of blinding was insufficiently described. High risk of bias: If no blinding or incomplete blinding of outcome assessors was performed. Low risk of bias: If it was mentioned that outcome assessors were blinded and this was described. Uncertain risk of bias: If it was not mentioned if the outcome assessors in the trial were blinded or the extent of blinding was insufficiently described. High risk of bias: If no blinding or incomplete blinding of outcome assessors was performed. Low risk of bias: If missing data were unlikely to make treatment effects depart from plausible values. This could be either (1) there were no drop-outs or withdrawals for all outcomes or (2) the numbers and reasons for the withdrawals and drop-outs for all outcomes were clearly stated and could be described as being similar to both groups. Generally, the trial is judged as at a low risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data if drop-outs are less than 5%. However, the 5% cut-off is not definitive. Uncertain risk of bias: If there was insufficient information to assess whether missing data were likely to induce bias on the results. High risk of bias: If the results were likely to be biased due to missing data either because the pattern of drop-outs could be described as being different in the two intervention groups or the trial used improper methods in dealing with the missing data (e.g. last observation carried forward). Low risk of bias: If missing data were unlikely to make treatment effects depart from plausible values. This could be either (1) there were no drop-outs or withdrawals for all outcomes or (2) the numbers and reasons for the withdrawals and drop-outs for all outcomes were clearly stated and could be described as being similar to both groups. Generally, the trial is judged as at a low risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data if drop-outs are less than 5%. However, the 5% cut-off is not definitive. Uncertain risk of bias: If there was insufficient information to assess whether missing data were likely to induce bias on the results. High risk of bias: If the results were likely to be biased due to missing data either because the pattern of drop-outs could be described as being different in the two intervention groups or the trial used improper methods in dealing with the missing data (e.g. last observation carried forward). Low risk of bias: If a protocol was published before or at the time the trial was begun and the outcomes specified in the protocol were reported on. If there is no protocol or the protocol was published after the trial has begun, reporting of all-cause mortality and serious adverse events will grant the trial a grade of low risk of bias. Uncertain risk of bias: If no protocol was published and the outcome all-cause mortality and serious adverse events were not reported on. High risk of bias: If the outcomes in the protocol were not reported on. Low risk of bias: If a protocol was published before or at the time the trial was begun and the outcomes specified in the protocol were reported on. If there is no protocol or the protocol was published after the trial has begun, reporting of all-cause mortality and serious adverse events will grant the trial a grade of low risk of bias. Uncertain risk of bias: If no protocol was published and the outcome all-cause mortality and serious adverse events were not reported on. High risk of bias: If the outcomes in the protocol were not reported on. Low risk of bias: If the trial appears to be free of other components (for example, academic bias or for-profit bias) that could put it at risk of bias. Unclear risk of bias: If the trial may or may not be free of other components that could put it at risk of bias. High risk of bias: If there are other factors in the trial that could put it at risk of bias (for example, authors conducted trials on the same topic, for-profit bias, etc.). Low risk of bias: If the trial appears to be free of other components (for example, academic bias or for-profit bias) that could put it at risk of bias. Unclear risk of bias: If the trial may or may not be free of other components that could put it at risk of bias. High risk of bias: If there are other factors in the trial that could put it at risk of bias (for example, authors conducted trials on the same topic, for-profit bias, etc.). Low risk of bias: The trial will be classified as overall ‘low risk of bias’ only if all of the bias domains described in the above paragraphs are classified as ‘low risk of bias’. High risk of bias: The trial will be classified as ‘high risk of bias’ if any of the bias risk domains described in the above are classified as ‘unclear’ or ‘high risk of bias’. Low risk of bias: The trial will be classified as overall ‘low risk of bias’ only if all of the bias domains described in the above paragraphs are classified as ‘low risk of bias’. High risk of bias: The trial will be classified as ‘high risk of bias’ if any of the bias risk domains described in the above are classified as ‘unclear’ or ‘high risk of bias’. We will assess the domains ‘blinding of outcome assessment’, ‘incomplete outcome data’, and ‘selective outcome reporting’ for each outcome result. Thus, we can assess the bias risk for each outcome assessed in addition to each trial. Our primary conclusions will be based on the results of our primary outcome results with overall low risk of bias. Both our primary and secondary conclusions will be presented in the summary of findings tables. We will conduct the review according to this published protocol and report any deviations from it in the ‘ Differences between the protocol and the review ’ section of the systematic review. We will calculate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, as well as the Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted CIs (see below). We will calculate the mean differences (MDs) and the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes, as well as the Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted CIs (see below). We will, as first option, contact all trial authors to obtain any relevant missing data (i.e. for data extraction and for assessment of risk of bias, as specified above). We will not impute missing values for any outcomes in our primary analysis. In two of our sensitivity analyses (see paragraph below), we will impute data. We will primarily analyse scores assessed at single time points. If only changes from baseline scores are reported, we will analyse the results together with follow-up scores . If standard deviations (SDs) are not reported, we will calculate the SDs using trial data, if possible. We will not use intention-to-treat data if the original report did not contain such data. We will not impute missing values for any outcomes in our primary analysis. In our sensitivity analysis (see paragraph below) for continuous outcomes, we will impute data. We will primarily investigate forest plots to visually assess any sign of heterogeneity. We will secondly assess the presence of statistical heterogeneity by chi 2 test (threshold P < 0.10) and measure the quantities of heterogeneity by the I 2 statistic . We will follow the recommendations for threshold by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions : 0 to 40%: might not be important 30 to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity 50 to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity 75 to 100%: may represent considerable heterogeneity 0 to 40%: might not be important 30 to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity 50 to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity 75 to 100%: may represent considerable heterogeneity We will investigate possible heterogeneity through subgroup analyses. Ultimately, we may decide that a meta-analysis should be avoided . We will use a funnel plot to assess reporting bias if ten or more trials are included. We will visually inspect funnel plots to assess the risk of bias. We are aware of the limitations of a funnel plot (i.e. a funnel plot assesses bias due to small sample size). From this information, we assess possible reporting bias. For dichotomous outcomes, we will test asymmetry with the Harbord test if τ 2 is less than 0.1 and with the Rücker test if τ 2 is more than 0.1. For continuous outcomes, we will use the regression asymmetry test and the adjusted rank correlation . We will only include randomised clinical trials. For trials using crossover design, only data from the first period will be included . There will therefore not be any unit of analysis issues. We will not include cluster randomised trials. We will undertake this meta-analysis according to the recommendations stated in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions , Keus et al. , and the eight-step assessment suggested by Jakobsen et al. . We will use the statistical software Review Manager 5.3 provided by Cochrane to analyse data. We will assess our intervention effects with both random-effects meta-analyses and fixed-effects meta-analyses . We will use the more conservative point estimate of the two . The more conservative point estimate is the estimate closest to zero effect. If the two estimates are similar, we will use the estimate with the widest CI. We use three primary outcomes, and therefore, we will consider a P value of 0.025 or less as the threshold for statistical significance . We use two secondary outcomes, and therefore, we will consider a P value of 0.033 or less as threshold for statistical significance . We will investigate possible heterogeneity through subgroup analyses. Ultimately, we may decide that a meta-analysis should be avoided . We will use the eight-step procedure to assess if the thresholds for significance are crossed . Our primary conclusion will be based on results with low risk of bias . Where multiple trial arms are reported in a single trial, we will include only the relevant arms. If two comparisons are combined in the same meta-analysis, we will halve the control group to avoid double-counting . Trials with a factorial design will be included. In case of, e.g. a 2 × 2 factorial designed trial, the two groups receiving rhythm control interventions will be considered rhythm control groups, while the two groups receiving rate control interventions will be considered rate control groups. If quantitative synthesis is not appropriate, we will report the results in a narrative way. Traditional meta-analysis runs the risk of random errors due to sparse data and repetitive testing of accumulating data when updating reviews. We wish to control the risks of type I errors and type II errors. We will therefore perform Trial Sequential Analysis on the outcomes, in order to calculate the required information size (that is the number of participants needed in a meta-analysis to detect or reject a certain intervention effect) and the cumulative Z-curve’s breach of relevant trial sequential monitoring boundaries . A more detailed description of Trial Sequential Analysis can be found in the Trial Sequential Analysis manual and at http://www.ctu.dk/tsa/ . For dichotomous outcomes, we will estimate the required information size based on the observed proportion of patients with an outcome in the control group (the cumulative proportion of patients with an event in the control groups relative to all patients in the control groups), a relative risk reduction of 15%, an alpha of 2.5% for our primary outcomes and an alpha of 3.3% for our secondary outcomes, a beta of 10%, and diversity as suggested by the trials in the meta-analysis. For continuous outcomes, we will in the Trial Sequential Analysis use the observed SD, a mean difference of the observed SD/2, an alpha of 2.5% for our primary outcomes and an alpha of 3.3% for our secondary outcomes, and a beta of 10%. We will perform the following subgroup analysis when analysing the primary outcomes (all-cause mortality, serious adverse event, and quality of life). High risk of bias trials compared to low risk of bias trials Comparison of individual rhythm control interventions with any rate control intervention Comparison of individual rate control interventions with any rhythm control intervention Participants with atrial fibrillation compared to participants with atrial flutter Age of participants: 0 to 59 years, 60 to 79 years, and above 80 years Duration of atrial fibrillation: recent-onset atrial fibrillation (as defined by the trialists), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (less than 7 days of onset), persistent atrial fibrillation (more than 7 days and less than 1 year of onset), and long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (more than 1 year of onset) Duration of anticoagulation therapy: anticoagulation therapy until sinus rhythm for at least 4 weeks, anticoagulation therapy until sinus rhythm for at least 12 weeks, or anticoagulation therapy until end of follow-up Men compared to women High risk of bias trials compared to low risk of bias trials Comparison of individual rhythm control interventions with any rate control intervention Comparison of individual rate control interventions with any rhythm control intervention Participants with atrial fibrillation compared to participants with atrial flutter Age of participants: 0 to 59 years, 60 to 79 years, and above 80 years Duration of atrial fibrillation: recent-onset atrial fibrillation (as defined by the trialists), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (less than 7 days of onset), persistent atrial fibrillation (more than 7 days and less than 1 year of onset), and long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (more than 1 year of onset) Duration of anticoagulation therapy: anticoagulation therapy until sinus rhythm for at least 4 weeks, anticoagulation therapy until sinus rhythm for at least 12 weeks, or anticoagulation therapy until end of follow-up Men compared to women We will use the formal test for subgroup interactions in Review Manager . To assess the potential impact of the missing data for dichotomous outcomes, we will perform the two following sensitivity analyses on both the primary and secondary outcomes. ‘Best-worst-case’ scenario: We will assume that all participants lost to follow-up in the rhythm control group have survived, had no serious adverse event, and had no stroke and that all those participants lost to follow-up in the rate control group have not survived, had a serious adverse event, and had a stroke. ‘Worst-best-case’ scenario: We will assume that all participants lost to follow-up in the rhythm control group have not survived, had a serious adverse event, and had a stroke and that all those participants lost to follow-up in the rate control group have survived, had no serious adverse event, and had no stroke. ‘Best-worst-case’ scenario: We will assume that all participants lost to follow-up in the rhythm control group have survived, had no serious adverse event, and had no stroke and that all those participants lost to follow-up in the rate control group have not survived, had a serious adverse event, and had a stroke. ‘Worst-best-case’ scenario: We will assume that all participants lost to follow-up in the rhythm control group have not survived, had a serious adverse event, and had a stroke and that all those participants lost to follow-up in the rate control group have survived, had no serious adverse event, and had no stroke. We will present results of both scenarios in our review. When analysing quality of life or ejection fraction, a ‘beneficial outcome’ will be the group mean plus two standard deviations (SDs) (we will secondly use one SD in another sensitivity analysis) of the group mean and a ‘harmful outcome’ will be the group mean minus two SDs (we will secondly use one SD in another sensitivity analysis) of the group mean . To assess the potential impact of missing SDs for continuous outcomes, we will perform the following sensitivity analysis. Where SDs are missing and it is not possible to calculate them, we will impute SDs from trials with similar populations and low risk of bias. If we find no such trials, we will impute SDs from trials with a similar population. As the final option, we will impute SDs from all trials. Where SDs are missing and it is not possible to calculate them, we will impute SDs from trials with similar populations and low risk of bias. If we find no such trials, we will impute SDs from trials with a similar population. As the final option, we will impute SDs from all trials. We will present results of this scenario in our review. Other post hoc sensitivity analyses might be warranted if unexpected clinical or statistical heterogeneity is identified during the analysis of the review results . We will create a Summary of Findings table using each of the prespecified outcomes (all-cause mortality, serious adverse event, quality of life, stroke, and ejection fraction). We will use the five GRADE considerations (bias risk of the trials, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the quality of a body of evidence as it relates to the studies which contribute data to the meta-analyses for the prespecified outcomes . We will use methods and recommendations described in Chapter 8 (Section 8.5) and Chapter 12 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions using GRADEpro software. We will justify all decisions to downgrade the quality of studies using footnotes, and we will make comments to aid the reader’s understanding of the review where necessary. Firstly, we will present our results in the Summary of Findings table based on the results from the trials with low risk of bias, and secondly, we will present the results based on all trials.Bias risk components (as defined below); trial design (parallel, factorial, or crossover); number of intervention arms; length of follow-up; estimation of sample size; inclusion and exclusion criteria.Number of randomised participants; number of analysed participants; number of participants lost to follow-up/withdrawals/crossover; compliance with medication; age range (mean or median) and sex ratio; type of arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter); baseline numbers of cardiovascular risk factors (i.e. diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, or smoking); baseline number of participants with heart failure; baseline number of participants with valvular heart disease; baseline number of participants with previous myocardial infarction; baseline number of participants with previous revascularisation; and baseline number of participants with previous angina. We will additionally report the proportion of participants in the compared groups who receive electrical cardioversion, atrioventricular node ablation, catheter ablation, and surgical ablation.Type of rhythm control intervention, type of rate control intervention, dose of intervention, duration of therapy, and mode of administration.Type of rate control intervention, dose of intervention, duration of therapy, and mode of administration.Type of co-intervention; dose of co-intervention; duration of co-intervention; and mode of administration.All outcomes listed above will be extracted from each randomised clinical trial, and we will identify if outcomes are incomplete or selectively reported according to the criteria described later in ‘incomplete outcome data’ bias domain and ‘selective outcome reporting’ bias domain.Funding of the trial and notable conflicts of interest of trial authors will be extracted, if available.

We will classify the trials according to the following criteria.Low risk: If sequence generation was achieved using computer random number generator or a random number table.

Unclear risk: If the method of randomisation was not specified, but the trial was still presented as being randomised.

High risk of bias: If no blinding or incomplete blinding of outcome assessors was performed.Low risk of bias: If missing data were unlikely to make treatment effects depart from plausible values. This could be either (1) there were no drop-outs or withdrawals for all outcomes or (2) the numbers and reasons for the withdrawals and drop-outs for all outcomes were clearly stated and could be described as being similar to both groups. Generally, the trial is judged as at a low risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data if drop-outs are less than 5%. However, the 5% cut-off is not definitive. Uncertain risk of bias: If there was insufficient information to assess whether missing data were likely to induce bias on the results. High risk of bias: If the results were likely to be biased due to missing data either because the pattern of drop-outs could be described as being different in the two intervention groups or the trial used improper methods in dealing with the missing data (e.g. last observation carried forward).

If there is no protocol or the protocol was published after the trial has begun, reporting of all-cause mortality and serious adverse events will grant the trial a grade of low risk of bias.

Low risk of bias: The trial will be classified as overall ‘low risk of bias’ only if all of the bias domains described in the above paragraphs are classified as ‘low risk of bias’. High risk of bias: The trial will be classified as ‘high risk of bias’ if any of the bias risk domains described in the above are classified as ‘unclear’ or ‘high risk of bias’. We will assess the domains ‘blinding of outcome assessment’, ‘incomplete outcome data’, and ‘selective outcome reporting’ for each outcome result. Thus, we can assess the bias risk for each outcome assessed in addition to each trial. Our primary conclusions will be based on the results of our primary outcome results with overall low risk of bias. Both our primary and secondary conclusions will be presented in the summary of findings tables.We will conduct the review according to this published protocol and report any deviations from it in the ‘ Differences between the protocol and the review ’ section of the systematic review.We will calculate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, as well as the Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted CIs (see below). We will calculate the mean differences (MDs) and the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes, as well as the Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted CIs (see below).We will calculate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, as well as the Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted CIs (see below).We will calculate the mean differences (MDs) and the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes, as well as the Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted CIs (see below).We will, as first option, contact all trial authors to obtain any relevant missing data (i.e. for data extraction and for assessment of risk of bias, as specified above). We will not impute missing values for any outcomes in our primary analysis. In two of our sensitivity analyses (see paragraph below), we will impute data. We will primarily analyse scores assessed at single time points. If only changes from baseline scores are reported, we will analyse the results together with follow-up scores . If standard deviations (SDs) are not reported, we will calculate the SDs using trial data, if possible. We will not use intention-to-treat data if the original report did not contain such data. We will not impute missing values for any outcomes in our primary analysis. In our sensitivity analysis (see paragraph below) for continuous outcomes, we will impute data.We will not impute missing values for any outcomes in our primary analysis. In two of our sensitivity analyses (see paragraph below), we will impute data.We will primarily analyse scores assessed at single time points.

We will not impute missing values for any outcomes in our primary analysis. In our sensitivity analysis (see paragraph below) for continuous outcomes, we will impute data.We will primarily investigate forest plots to visually assess any sign of heterogeneity. We will secondly assess the presence of statistical heterogeneity by chi 2 test (threshold P < 0.10) and measure the quantities of heterogeneity by the I 2 statistic . We will follow the recommendations for threshold by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions : 0 to 40%: might not be important 30 to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity 50 to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity 75 to 100%: may represent considerable heterogeneity 0 to 40%: might not be important 30 to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity 50 to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity 75 to 100%: may represent considerable heterogeneity We will investigate possible heterogeneity through subgroup analyses. Ultimately, we may decide that a meta-analysis should be avoided .We will use a funnel plot to assess reporting bias if ten or more trials are included. We will visually inspect funnel plots to assess the risk of bias. We are aware of the limitations of a funnel plot (i.e. a funnel plot assesses bias due to small sample size). From this information, we assess possible reporting bias. For dichotomous outcomes, we will test asymmetry with the Harbord test if τ 2 is less than 0.1 and with the Rücker test if τ 2 is more than 0.1. For continuous outcomes, we will use the regression asymmetry test and the adjusted rank correlation . We will only include randomised clinical trials. For trials using crossover design, only data from the first period will be included . There will therefore not be any unit of analysis issues. We will not include cluster randomised trials.We will only include randomised clinical trials. For trials using crossover design, only data from the first period will be included . There will therefore not be any unit of analysis issues. We will not include cluster randomised trials.We will undertake this meta-analysis according to the recommendations stated in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions , Keus et al. , and the eight-step assessment suggested by Jakobsen et al. . We will use the statistical software Review Manager 5.3 provided by Cochrane to analyse data. We will assess our intervention effects with both random-effects meta-analyses and fixed-effects meta-analyses . We will use the more conservative point estimate of the two . The more conservative point estimate is the estimate closest to zero effect. If the two estimates are similar, we will use the estimate with the widest CI. We use three primary outcomes, and therefore, we will consider a P value of 0.025 or less as the threshold for statistical significance . We use two secondary outcomes, and therefore, we will consider a P value of 0.033 or less as threshold for statistical significance . We will investigate possible heterogeneity through subgroup analyses. Ultimately, we may decide that a meta-analysis should be avoided . We will use the eight-step procedure to assess if the thresholds for significance are crossed . Our primary conclusion will be based on results with low risk of bias . Where multiple trial arms are reported in a single trial, we will include only the relevant arms. If two comparisons are combined in the same meta-analysis, we will halve the control group to avoid double-counting . Trials with a factorial design will be included. In case of, e.g. a 2 × 2 factorial designed trial, the two groups receiving rhythm control interventions will be considered rhythm control groups, while the two groups receiving rate control interventions will be considered rate control groups. If quantitative synthesis is not appropriate, we will report the results in a narrative way. Traditional meta-analysis runs the risk of random errors due to sparse data and repetitive testing of accumulating data when updating reviews. We wish to control the risks of type I errors and type II errors. We will therefore perform Trial Sequential Analysis on the outcomes, in order to calculate the required information size (that is the number of participants needed in a meta-analysis to detect or reject a certain intervention effect) and the cumulative Z-curve’s breach of relevant trial sequential monitoring boundaries . A more detailed description of Trial Sequential Analysis can be found in the Trial Sequential Analysis manual and at http://www.ctu.dk/tsa/ . For dichotomous outcomes, we will estimate the required information size based on the observed proportion of patients with an outcome in the control group (the cumulative proportion of patients with an event in the control groups relative to all patients in the control groups), a relative risk reduction of 15%, an alpha of 2.5% for our primary outcomes and an alpha of 3.3% for our secondary outcomes, a beta of 10%, and diversity as suggested by the trials in the meta-analysis. For continuous outcomes, we will in the Trial Sequential Analysis use the observed SD, a mean difference of the observed SD/2, an alpha of 2.5% for our primary outcomes and an alpha of 3.3% for our secondary outcomes, and a beta of 10%.We will undertake this meta-analysis according to the recommendations stated in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions , Keus et al. , and the eight-step assessment suggested by Jakobsen et al. .

High risk of bias trials compared to low risk of bias trials Comparison of individual rhythm control interventions with any rate control intervention Comparison of individual rate control interventions with any rhythm control intervention Participants with atrial fibrillation compared to participants with atrial flutter Age of participants: 0 to 59 years, 60 to 79 years, and above 80 years Duration of atrial fibrillation: recent-onset atrial fibrillation (as defined by the trialists), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (less than 7 days of onset), persistent atrial fibrillation (more than 7 days and less than 1 year of onset), and long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (more than 1 year of onset) Duration of anticoagulation therapy: anticoagulation therapy until sinus rhythm for at least 4 weeks, anticoagulation therapy until sinus rhythm for at least 12 weeks, or anticoagulation therapy until end of follow-up Men compared to women High risk of bias trials compared to low risk of bias trials Comparison of individual rhythm control interventions with any rate control intervention Comparison of individual rate control interventions with any rhythm control intervention Participants with atrial fibrillation compared to participants with atrial flutter Age of participants: 0 to 59 years, 60 to 79 years, and above 80 years Duration of atrial fibrillation: recent-onset atrial fibrillation (as defined by the trialists), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (less than 7 days of onset), persistent atrial fibrillation (more than 7 days and less than 1 year of onset), and long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (more than 1 year of onset) Duration of anticoagulation therapy: anticoagulation therapy until sinus rhythm for at least 4 weeks, anticoagulation therapy until sinus rhythm for at least 12 weeks, or anticoagulation therapy until end of follow-up Men compared to women We will use the formal test for subgroup interactions in Review Manager . To assess the potential impact of the missing data for dichotomous outcomes, we will perform the two following sensitivity analyses on both the primary and secondary outcomes. ‘Best-worst-case’ scenario: We will assume that all participants lost to follow-up in the rhythm control group have survived, had no serious adverse event, and had no stroke and that all those participants lost to follow-up in the rate control group have not survived, had a serious adverse event, and had a stroke. ‘Worst-best-case’ scenario: We will assume that all participants lost to follow-up in the rhythm control group have not survived, had a serious adverse event, and had a stroke and that all those participants lost to follow-up in the rate control group have survived, had no serious adverse event, and had no stroke. ‘Best-worst-case’ scenario: We will assume that all participants lost to follow-up in the rhythm control group have survived, had no serious adverse event, and had no stroke and that all those participants lost to follow-up in the rate control group have not survived, had a serious adverse event, and had a stroke. ‘Worst-best-case’ scenario: We will assume that all participants lost to follow-up in the rhythm control group have not survived, had a serious adverse event, and had a stroke and that all those participants lost to follow-up in the rate control group have survived, had no serious adverse event, and had no stroke. We will present results of both scenarios in our review. When analysing quality of life or ejection fraction, a ‘beneficial outcome’ will be the group mean plus two standard deviations (SDs) (we will secondly use one SD in another sensitivity analysis) of the group mean and a ‘harmful outcome’ will be the group mean minus two SDs (we will secondly use one SD in another sensitivity analysis) of the group mean . To assess the potential impact of missing SDs for continuous outcomes, we will perform the following sensitivity analysis. Where SDs are missing and it is not possible to calculate them, we will impute SDs from trials with similar populations and low risk of bias. If we find no such trials, we will impute SDs from trials with a similar population. As the final option, we will impute SDs from all trials. Where SDs are missing and it is not possible to calculate them, we will impute SDs from trials with similar populations and low risk of bias. If we find no such trials, we will impute SDs from trials with a similar population. As the final option, we will impute SDs from all trials. We will present results of this scenario in our review. Other post hoc sensitivity analyses might be warranted if unexpected clinical or statistical heterogeneity is identified during the analysis of the review results . We will create a Summary of Findings table using each of the prespecified outcomes (all-cause mortality, serious adverse event, quality of life, stroke, and ejection fraction). We will use the five GRADE considerations (bias risk of the trials, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the quality of a body of evidence as it relates to the studies which contribute data to the meta-analyses for the prespecified outcomes . We will use methods and recommendations described in Chapter 8 (Section 8.5) and Chapter 12 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions using GRADEpro software. We will justify all decisions to downgrade the quality of studies using footnotes, and we will make comments to aid the reader’s understanding of the review where necessary. Firstly, we will present our results in the Summary of Findings table based on the results from the trials with low risk of bias, and secondly, we will present the results based on all trials.We will perform the following subgroup analysis when analysing the primary outcomes (all-cause mortality, serious adverse event, and quality of life).

Firstly, we will present our results in the Summary of Findings table based on the results from the trials with low risk of bias, and secondly, we will present the results based on all trials.This protocol aims at comparing the effects of rhythm control strategies with the effects of rate control strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter to determine the best overall treatment strategy. The outcomes will be all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, quality of life, stroke, and ejection fraction. This protocol has a number of strengths. The predefined methodology is based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions , the eight-step assessment suggested by Jakobsen et al. , Trial Sequential Analysis , and GRADE assessment . Hence, this protocol takes into account both risks of random errors and risks of systematic errors. Another strength of this protocol is that we pragmatically compare two overall treatment strategies with each other, i.e. the results of this review will potentially reflect the effects of the two strategies in clinical everyday practice. Our protocol also has a number of limitations. The primary limitation is that both of the strategies we compare consist of multiple treatment elements and it is likely that different interventions have different effects. Hence, if we show a difference between the compared strategies, it will be difficult to conclude what exactly caused the difference in effect. To minimise this limitation, a number of subgroups are planned, but results of subgroup analyses should always be interpreted with great caution. Another limitation is the large number of comparisons which increase the risk of type 1 error. We have adjusted our thresholds for significance according to the number of primary outcomes, but, as mentioned, we have also included multiple subgroup analyses. This large risk of type 1 error will be taken into account when interpreting the review results.',\n",

       "  'abstract_text': 'Established primary prevention strategies of cardiovascular diseases are based on understanding of risk factors, but whether the same risk factors are associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review and field synopsis of the associations of 23 cardiovascular risk factors and incident AF, which included 84 reports based on 28 consented and four electronic health record cohorts of 20,420,175 participants and 576,602 AF events. We identified 3-19 reports per risk factor and heterogeneity in AF definition, quality of reporting, and adjustment. We extracted relative risks (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals and visualised the number of reports with inverse (RR <1.00), or direct (RR >1.00) associations. For hypertension (13/17 reports) and obesity (19/19 reports), there were direct associations with incident AF, as there are for coronary heart disease (CHD). There were inverse associations for non-White ethnicity (5/5 reports, with RR from 0.35 to 0.84 ), total cholesterol (4/13 reports from 0.76 to 0.94 ; 8/13 reports with non-significant inverse associations), and diastolic blood pressure (2/11 reports from 0.87 to 0.92 ; 5/11 reports with non-significant inverse associations), and direct associations for taller height (7/10 reports from 1.03 to 1.92 ), which are in the opposite direction of known associations with CHD. A systematic evaluation of the available evidence suggests similarities as well as important differences in the risk factors for incidence of AF as compared with other cardiovascular diseases, which has implications for the primary prevention strategies for atrial fibrillation.',\n",
       "  'article_text': 'Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common heart rhythm disorder, affecting 33.5 million people globally in 2010 ( 1 ). AF accounts for 1 in 4 ischaemic strokes ( 2 ), doubles the risk of death ( 3 ), places an economic burden on healthcare systems ( 4 ), and is projected to affect twice as many people by 2050 ( 5 , 6 ). Yet to date, there have been no clinical trials of healthy participants without cardiovascular disease (CVD), and with AF as the primary outcome ( 7 ). The focus of trials has instead been on prevention of stroke and thromboembolism after diagnosis of AF. Community screening programmes for detection of AF ( 8 ), are also designed to identify patients at high risk of stroke and thromboembolism, and do not identify those who are at an initially high risk of later developing AF. Thus, current clinical guidelines make no recommendations for the primary prevention of AF itself, among people without CVDs ( 9–11 ). Established primary prevention strategies of other CVDs, such as coronary heart disease (CHD) ( 12 ), and stroke ( 13 ), are based on understanding of risk factors, but the extent to which the same risk factors are associated with the incidence of AF is not fully understood. Ultimately, it is not known whether existing CVD prevention strategies can also work in preventing AF, or whether there may be important clinical differences. In synthesising available evidence the conventional (near universal) approach is to examine risk factors one at a time. Single risk factor systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been carried out for alcohol ( 14–16 ), C–reactive protein ( 17 ), diabetes mellitus ( 18 ), obesity ( 19 ), physical activity ( 20 , 21 ), and renal function ( 22 ) in relation to AF risk. Each of these reviews uses non-identical methods, for example varying in the extent to which incident AF is analysed among people free from pre-existing CVD. While there is an important ongoing role for the vertical approach of a single risk factor meta-analysis (particularly if methods can be aligned), there is also a complementary role for a horizontal ‘field synopsis’ approach across multiple potential risk factors. The term field synopsis is defined as a systematic evaluation of evidence in which the i) overall amount, ii) extent of replication, and iii) protection from bias is considered across the whole field ( 23 , 24 ). One advantage of a field synopsis in multifactorial diseases is to provide an unbiased empirical basis for prioritising further research into risk factors with preventive potential. We therefore conducted a systematic review and field synopsis of the associations of a wide range of demographic, behavioural, and biological CVD risk factors and incidence of AF in general populations and populations initially free from diagnosed CVD. Field synopses’ of cumulative evidence ( 23 , 24 ), are common in genetics but have seldom been applied in the context of preventive medicine. Our objectives were i) to determine the amount of evidence for each risk factor, ii) to evaluate the extent to which each risk factor shows concordant or discordant associations with AF incidence across independent study populations, and iii) to systematically appraise the quality of the observational evidence across the field of AF prevention research.Our approach to the search, selection, data collection and analysis of reports was systematic, and guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist ( 25 ). We queried the PubMed database using the search terms listed in the Appendix p 3, for original research reports that were published in English up to October 1, 2015; involving prospective, population based cohorts that were either initially free from diagnosed CVD at baseline or were general population cohorts in which the proportion of people with diagnosed CVD at baseline was low reflecting prevalence in the general population. Cohorts were of any age, and without prior AF; and investigated the association between “risk factors” and incident AF, over any follow–up period, and using Cox proportional hazards or Poisson regression models adjusted or stratified for age and sex as a minimum. We shortlisted 23 cardiovascular risk factors (listed in ► Table 1 ) for review, based on clinical relevance as an established predictor or treatment target in the prevention of CVD ( 12 ), or on clinical opinion of an association with AF ( 9 ), and on expert consensus between authors. Reference lists of identified reports, existing reviews and meta–analyses (which were not restricted to prospective cohorts of individuals either free from or with general population levels of baseline CVD: alcohol ( 14–16 ), C–reactive protein ( 17 ), diabetes mellitus ( 18 ), obesity ( 19 ), physical activity ( 20 , 21 ), and renal function ( 22 )), were hand–searched for additional reports. Two out of three authors (JW, SH, VA) reviewed the inclusion of each report based on title, then abstract, then full–text. Disagreements were resolved by joint full–text review with a third independent reviewer (RH). From each report the following information was extracted: design of cohort (consented participant cohort with research measures at baseline and follow-up, or electronic health record (EHR) cohort in which anonymised data collected as part of usual clinical care was used for baseline and follow–up measures), country, sample size (number of participants at baseline) and number of AF events over follow–up (based on the highest figure reported), age range, proportion of female participants, mean or median follow–up, methods of AF ascertainment, risk factor definition, statistical model, and risk factors used in adjustment. We extracted data on whether cardiovascular events, prevalent at baseline and incident during follow–up and preceding AF were accounted for. For each risk factor, we extracted adjusted relative risks (RR), and 95 % confidence intervals . Where there were multiple RR reported within a publication, or across multiple publications from the same cohort, we selected the most adjusted estimate, modelled with the highest number of AF cases. We summarised the overall results of the field of cohort epidemiology of AF by plotting the number of reports with inverse (RR<1.00), null or mixed (RR=1.00 or shows opposite associations among subpopulations), or direct relationship (RR>1.00) with AF incidence. We regarded the association as significant if the 95 % CI did not cross unity. Unless stated, RR are given as originally reported. For each factor, we then plotted the RR and 95 % CI using R–3.2.0 (CALIBERdatamanage package, available at: caliberresearch.org). We summarised the quality of reporting by completeness of the items listed in the above data extraction section (items not reported (NR) are clearly indicated in tables and figures). We summarised the quality of analysis by assessment of the number (%) of adjustment made for the 23 risk factors, and whether adjustment was made for six standard CVD risk factors (age, sex, smoking, blood pressure, lipids and diabetes mellitus), and for prevalent and incident CVD events. We visualised these as “Swiss cheese” plots ( 26 ).We queried the PubMed database using the search terms listed in the Appendix p 3, for original research reports that were published in English up to October 1, 2015; involving prospective, population based cohorts that were either initially free from diagnosed CVD at baseline or were general population cohorts in which the proportion of people with diagnosed CVD at baseline was low reflecting prevalence in the general population.

Disagreements were resolved by joint full–text review with a third independent reviewer (RH).From each report the following information was extracted: design of cohort (consented participant cohort with research measures at baseline and follow-up, or electronic health record (EHR) cohort in which anonymised data collected as part of usual clinical care was used for baseline and follow–up measures), country, sample size (number of participants at baseline) and number of AF events over follow–up (based on the highest figure reported), age range, proportion of female participants, mean or median follow–up, methods of AF ascertainment, risk factor definition, statistical model, and risk factors used in adjustment. We extracted data on whether cardiovascular events, prevalent at baseline and incident during follow–up and preceding AF were accounted for. For each risk factor, we extracted adjusted relative risks (RR), and 95 % confidence intervals . Where there were multiple RR reported within a publication, or across multiple publications from the same cohort, we selected the most adjusted estimate, modelled with the highest number of AF cases.We summarised the overall results of the field of cohort epidemiology of AF by plotting the number of reports with inverse (RR<1.00), null or mixed (RR=1.00 or shows opposite associations among subpopulations), or direct relationship (RR>1.00) with AF incidence. We regarded the association as significant if the 95 % CI did not cross unity. Unless stated, RR are given as originally reported. For each factor, we then plotted the RR and 95 % CI using R–3.2.0 (CALIBERdatamanage package, available at: caliberresearch.org).We summarised the quality of reporting by completeness of the items listed in the above data extraction section (items not reported (NR) are clearly indicated in tables and figures). We summarised the quality of analysis by assessment of the number (%) of adjustment made for the 23 risk factors, and whether adjustment was made for six standard CVD risk factors (age, sex, smoking, blood pressure, lipids and diabetes mellitus), and for prevalent and incident CVD events. We visualised these as “Swiss cheese” plots ( 26 ).Out of 2777 publications, 73 were included (Suppl. Figure S1, Appendix p 4) with 84 reports on 32 cohorts from 10 countries and 20,420,175 participants ( 16 , 27–98 ). As ► Table 2 (available online at www.thrombosis-online.com ) shows, 28 (87.5 %) cohorts involved consented participants with 39,900 (6.9 %) events, and four cohorts (12.5 %) were EHR–based with 536,702 (93.1 %) events. AF events were ascertained from a research electrocardiogram (40 reports (47.6 %)), diagnosis codes from medical records (60 reports (71.4 %)), or using a combination of both methods (24 reports (28.6 %)). As Suppl. Table S1 (Appendix pp 5–7) shows, 17 reports (20.2 %) described using two out of four types of medical records (i. e. general practitioner, hospital care, prescriptions, or mortality records), but no report used three or all four types combined. Age range was not reported in 30 reports (35.7 %), mean or median follow–up in 18 reports (21.4 %), and risk factor definition was not reported in nine reports (10.7 %). Information was consistently reported on country, sample size, female participants, and AF events. Overall, 63 reports (75.0 %) lacked adjustment for all six standard CVD risk factors (Suppl. Table S2, Appendix pp 8–9). Age was adjusted for in 84 reports (100.0 %), sex in 80 reports (95.2 %), smoking in 49 reports (58.3 %), blood pressure in 63 reports (75.0 %), lipids in 32 reports (38.1 %), and diabetes mellitus in 59 reports (70.2 %). The total number of adjustment factors ranged from 2–14 factors, with a median of eight factors. There was lack of adjustment for prevalent CVD in 30 reports (35.7 %), and for incident CVD in 69 reports (82.1 %). A summary of the heterogeneity of associations of 23 risk factors and incidence of AF are visualised in ► Figure 1 , and for each factor separately in ► Figures 2–6 and Suppl. Figures S2–S19 (Appendix pp 12–29). There was no evidence of small study bias. For age, all 15 reports showed significant direct associations, but these were heterogeneous. RR ranged from 1.02 to 1.14 for every 1–year, from 1.43 to 1.65 for every 5–year, from 1.09 to 2.35 for every 10–year, and from 1.36 to 4.34 for every standard deviation (NR) year increase in age (Suppl. Figure S2 in Appendix) ( 28 , 32 , 35 , 37 , 43 , 47 , 50 , 55 , 67 , 70 , 88 , 90 , 94 , 98 ). For men (compared to women), one report showed a significant inverse association (0.70 ) ( 79 ), two reports were inverse but non-significant (from 0.95 to 0.96) ( 88 , 98 ), and eight reports showed significant direct associations (from 1.45 to 1.90 ) (Suppl. Figure S3 in Appendix) ( 37 , 43 , 47 , 50 , 55 , 70 , 94 ). For African-American, Asian, Chinese, Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Black (compared to White) ethnicities, all five reports showed significant inverse associations (from 0.35 to 0.84 ) ( 28 , 44 , 85 , 92 ). Only one country reported estimates for the association of ethnicity and incidence of AF (► Figure 2 ). For socio–economic status, two reports showed significant inverse associations, three reports were inverse but non-significant, and one report showed a mixed association (see Appendix p 10 and Suppl. Figure S4 for further details). For current smoking, one report was inverse but non-significant (0.78) ( 35 ), one report showed a mixed association ( 47 ), five reports were direct but non-significant (from 1.01 to 1.20) ( 54 , 56 , 70 , 83 , 88 ), and six reports showed significant direct associations (from 1.32 to 2.00 ) (Suppl. Figure S5 in Appendix, available online at www.thrombosis-online.com ) ( 28 , 37 , 40 , 47 , 78 , 79 ). For physical activity, three reports showed significant inverse associations, four reports were inverse but non-significant, two reports showed null or mixed associations, and two reports were direct but non-significant (see Appendix p 10 and Suppl. Figure S6). For alcohol intake in drinks per day or week, in grams per day or week, or for current alcohol drinkers, two reports showed significant inverse associations (from 0.65 to 0.96 ) ( 53 , 83 ), one report was inverse but non-significant (0.97) ( 46 ), one report showed a null association ( 28 ), three reports were direct but non-significant (from 1.04 to 1.20) ( 35 , 70 , 79 ), and three reports showed significant direct associations (from 1.39 to 2.90 ) ( 16 , 64 , 88 ). All 10 alcohol reports defined alcohol intake differently, and as shown for the three direct alcohol associations, the increased risk of developing AF was only among the highest alcohol intake categories (► Figure 3 ). For every 10–22 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure, or systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg, one report showed a null association ( 79 ), five reports were direct but non-significant (from 1.01 to 1.24) ( 35 , 47 , 55 , 83 , 84 ), and eight reports showed significant direct associations (from 1.14 to 2.63 ) (Suppl. Figure S7 in Appendix) ( 46 , 47 , 50 , 56 , 65 , 69 , 90 , 91 ). For every 10–11 mmHg increase in diastolic blood pressure, or diastolic blood pressure ≥95–100 mmHg, two reports showed signifitein cant inverse associations (from 0.87 to 0.92 ) ( 50 , 69 ), five reports were inverse but non-significant (from 0.82 to 0.99) ( 47 , 55 , 83 , 84 , 91 ), two reports were direct but non-significant (from 1.02 to 1.23) ( 47 , 65 ), and two reports showed significant direct associations (from 1.24 to 2.02 ) ( 46 , 90 ). No EHR cohorts reported estimates for the association of diastolic blood pressure and incidence of AF (► Figure 4 ). For hypertension, one report was inverse but non-significant (0.93) ( 88 ), three reports were direct but non-significant (from 1.21 to 1.37) ( 35 , 55 , 79 ), and 13 reports showed significant direct associations (from 1.28 to 2.60 ) (Suppl. Figure S8 in Appendix) ( 28 , 31 , 37 , 40 , 47 , 50 , 56 , 67 , 70 , 87 , 91 , 98 ). For every 10–50 mg/dl increase in total cholesterol, or total cholesterol ≥220–280 mg/dl, four reports showed significant inverse associations (from 0.76 to 0.94 ) ( 32 , 47 , 53 , 61 ), eight reports were inverse but non-significant (from 0.57 to 0.99) ( 35 , 41 , 47 , 56 , 67 , 71 , 83 , 88 ), and one report was direct but non-significant (1.13) ( 71 ). Both inverse and direct associations were shown in the three total cholesterol reports that adjusted for prevalent and incident CVD events (► Figure 5 ). For every 10–40 mg/dl increase in low–density lipoprotein cholesterol, or low–density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥150 mg/dl, two reports showed significant inverse associations (from 0.72 to 0.92 ) ( 32 , 61 ), four reports were inverse but non-significant (from 0.85 to 0.95) ( 41 , 55 , 71 , 83 ), and one report was direct but non-significant (1.15) (Suppl. Figure S9 in Appendix) ( 71 ). For every 15 mg/dl increase in high–density lipoprotein cholesterol, or high–density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥60mg/dl, five reports were inverse but non-significant (from 0.85 to 0.98) ( 32 , 47 , 71 ), two reports showed null or mixed associations ( 41 , 47 ), two reports were direct but non-significant (from 1.01 to 1.07) ( 61 , 83 ), and one report showed a significant direct association (1.16 ) (Suppl. Figure 10 in Appendix) ( 67 ). For triglycerides, three reports were inverse but non-significant, one report showed a mixed association, two reports were direct but non-significant, and three reports showed significant direct associations (see Appendix p 10 and Suppl. Figure S11). For diabetes mellitus (type unspecified), two reports were inverse but non-significant (from 0.86 to 0.98) ( 83 , 98 ), eight reports were direct but non-significant (from 1.02 to 1.49) ( 37 , 47 , 54 , 56 , 58 , 67 , 70 ), and six reports showed significant direct associations (from 1.17 to 1.80 ) (Suppl. Figure S12 in Appendix) ( 28 , 40 , 50 , 79 , 88 , 95 ). For renal function, three reports were inverse but non-significant, five reports were direct but non-significant, and three reports showed significant direct associations (see Appendix p 11 and Suppl. Figure S13). For every 1–10 cm increase in height, or height ≥173 cm, three reports were direct but non-significant (from 1.14 to 1.17) ( 47 , 67 , 70 ), and seven reports showed significant direct associations (from 1.03 to 1.92 ) ( 34 , 46 , 47 , 53 , 56 , 79 , 89 ) (► Figure 6 ). For weight, all eight reports showed significant direct associations (see Appendix p 11 and Suppl. Figure S14). For every 1–10 kg/m 2 increase in body mass index (BMI), or BMI ≥25–30 kg/m 2 , all 19 reports showed significant direct associations (from 1.04 to 2.24 ) (Suppl. Figure S15 in Appendix) ( 28 , 31 , 34 , 37 , 39 , 48 , 55 , 56 , 60 , 67 , 70 , 76 , 79 , 81 , 83 , 88–91 ). For C–reactive protein, four reports were direct but non-significant, and four reports showed significant direct associations (see Appendix p 11 and Suppl. Figure S16). For fibrinogen, two reports were inverse but non-significant, one report was direct but non-significant, and three reports showed significant direct associations (see Appendix p 11 and Suppl. Figure S17). For every 1.0 mU/l decrease in thyroid stimulating hormone, or thyroid stimulating hormone <0.10–0.45 mU/l, one report was inverse but non-significant (0.34) ( 82 ), five reports were direct but non-significant (from 1.06 to 2.85) ( 51 , 77 , 82 ), and two reports showed significant direct associations (from 1.41 to 3.10 ) (Suppl. Figure S18 in Appendix) ( 72 , 96 ). For autoimmune diseases, all three reports showed significant direct associations (see Appendix p 11 and Suppl. Figure S19). To our knowledge this is the first example of a field synopsis evaluating associations across multiple risk factors and disease incidence. We systematically evaluated 84 reports from 32 independent cohorts for the impact of 23 cardiovascular risk factors on incidence of AF. Unlike previous overviews of AF risk factors ( 10 , 99 ), we focussed exclusively on primary prevention among populations initially free from diagnosed CVD or general populations in which baseline levels of CVD reflected prevalence in the general population. We found some evidence that ethnicity, height, diastolic blood pressure and serum cholesterol, are associated with AF incidence in opposite directions to their known associations with CHD and stroke. Furthermore we found only modest evidence for the widely held clinical opinion that excess alcohol is associated with risk of AF. Taken together our findings suggest that primary prevention strategies for AF may require some different elements from the current approaches used for other CVDs. For some risk factors – hypertension, and higher BMI – there were consistent, direct associations with incident AF, as there are for CHD. This could reflect a causal link with AF, or that the risk factor causes CHD, which in turn causes AF. Surprisingly, we found that only three (out of 14) reports investigating the association between systolic blood pressure and incident AF accounted for both prevalent and intercurrent incident cardiovascular events, and only one of which reported a significant direct association. Several post-hoc analyses of trials have suggested a possible benefit of ACE/ARB–inhibitors ( 100 ), and other blood–pressure lowering medications ( 101 ), for prevention of AF. However, we demonstrate that across all 23 risk factors, the available observational evidence does not fully consider a mechanism or confounding of reported associations by intercurrent CHD. Current clinical guidelines include alcohol in a list of potentially “reversible” causes of AF, but acknowledge that there is no evidence to suggest addressing any of these is effective in preventing AF ( 9 ). We found a small number of reports (3 out of 10) suggesting a direct association between alcohol intake and AF incidence. This is in contrast to three existing alcohol reviews (Samokhvalov et al. ( 14 ), Kodama et al. ( 15 ) and Larsson et al. ( 16 )), which have reported dose–response relationships. There are several possible explanations as to why our findings differ. Unlike the previous alcohol reviews, ours considers i) only prospective studies (Samokhvalov et al. and Kodama et al. included retrospective studies; similarly Larsson et al. focused on prospective studies), ii) only general population cohorts (Larsson et al. included one cohort with pre-existing CVD), iii) only incident AF events (Kodama et al. included studies on AF recurrence), iv) only estimates from Cox or Poisson regression (Samokhvalov et al., Kodama et al., and Larsson et al. all included estimates from logistic regression), v) only the most adjusted alcohol estimate per cohort (Samokhvalov et al. included the study with the most comprehensive alcohol data, while Larsson et al. did not report an approach to selecting from multiple estimates per cohort), and lastly vi) our more recent review and more inclusive field synopsis method includes eight reports that have not been included in the previous reviews ( 28 , 35 , 46 , 53 , 70 , 79 , 83 , 88 ). Based on the three direct alcohol associations we identified, the increased risk of developing AF was confined to the highest alcohol intake levels, as opposed to there being a J–shaped or dose–response relationship. Overall, our findings indicate that at present, there is limited consistent evidence on which recommended alcohol intake levels for primary prevention of AF could be based. We found some evidence that white ethnicity, taller height, lower total cholesterol and lower diastolic blood pressure might confer a higher risk of incident AF, which is in the opposite direction to their known associations with incident CHD ( 12 ). Our findings regarding cholesterol suggest that reducing cholesterol may not be relevant for the primary prevention of AF, and are in line with an existing meta–analysis of trial evidence, which did not support the role of statins for prevention of AF in participants with underlying CVD ( 102 ). Previously, it been demonstrated that blood pressure has markedly different associations with the incidence of 12 individual cardiovascular diseases (not including AF) ( 103 ). We now provide some, albeit mixed, evidence that this may also be the case for AF. The direct and inverse associations shown for systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively, may indicate high pulse pressure, which is a marker of arterial stiffness and is more prevalent in older populations ( 104 ). Two earlier studies found an association between pulse pressure and incidence of AF ( 69 , 84 ); however, pulse pressure was not considered in this review as its clinical utility is not well defined ( 105 ). The observational evidence summarised here suggests that programmes for AF primary prevention may need to differ slightly from those which have guided clinicians and public health practitioners in the primary prevention of other CVDs. Existing management strategies to tackle obesity, smoking, alcohol and hypertension may have a role but the current evidence is insufficient to design AF specific interventions. The risk factors included in available prediction tools for 5- or 10-year risk of incident AF are supported by our systematic review, and these tools should be used more frequently in clinical practice ( 47 , 70 ). Such risk prediction tools could identify high–risk individuals for inclusion in primary prevention trials in AF, where there is the largest knowledge gap. Overall, we found a relatively “young” field, which has been rapidly expanding over the last five years (see Suppl. Figure S20, Appendix p 30). Although we included 32 cohorts of 20 million participants and 600,000 AF events, we found a limited number of reports (between 3 and 19) per risk factor. Although we identified some efforts at pooling studies (e. g. the CHARGE–AF consortium of 5 cohorts, 3 countries, and 1771 AF events (47)), the amount of evidence available is markedly smaller than the scale of cohort evidence available on risk factors for CHD or stroke incidence (e. g. The Emerging Risk Factor Collaboration consists of over 100 cohorts ( 106 )). Next, we found that the AF field is beginning to span both consented population and electronic health record studies, with all seven EHR reports published in 2011–2015. In the era of “big data” research, EHRs offer the potential for studying associations at much larger scale, at population–level, in comparison with other risk factors, and across a wide range of diseases ( 107 ). What is known about this topic? Atrial fibrillation is the world’s most common heart rhythm disorder, and leading cause of fatal and disabling strokes, yet current clinical practice guidelines offer no recommendations for primary prevention in individuals without pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Established primary prevention strategies of other cardiovascular diseases (e. g. coronary heart disease and stroke), are based on understanding of risk factors, but whether the same risk factors are associated with incident atrial fibrillation remains unclear. There is a lack of systematic reviews and field synopses of risk factors for atrial fibrillation among general populations and populations initially free from diagnosed CVD. What does this paper add? A systematic evaluation of evidence from 28 consented and four electronic health record cohorts confirms the importance of hypertension and obesity, but suggests important differences in the risk factors for incident atrial fibrillation as compared with other cardiovascular diseases. Non-white ethnicity, shorter height, higher cholesterol and higher diastolic blood pressure all showed some evidence of being associated with lower risk of incident AF. This contrasts with the known associations of these risk factors in the opposite direction with coronary heart disease. The evidence for the widely held clinical opinion that alcohol use is associated with incident AF in the primary preventative setting was modest. These findings provide a systematic basis on which to direct research into the primary prevention of AF. What is known about this topic?

These findings provide a systematic basis on which to direct research into the primary prevention of AF. None of the EHR cohorts analysed continuous measures of blood pressure, lipids, BMI, or renal function. Linking data from consented population and EHR sources therefore represents an important research opportunity to investigate risk factors for AF at depth and at scale. Finally, we found considerable heterogeneity in study design and reporting, and a lack of consistent approach to adjustment for other risk factors (visualised as a “Swiss cheese”). Field synopses allow for differences in study designs, however in order to further inform primary preventive programmes and estimate the precision effect of each risk factor in meta-analyses; there is a need for large–scale strategic co–ordination of the field of AF prevention research. The principle strength of our study – evaluation across a comprehensive range of risk factors – is also the principle weakness. In order to evaluate the breadth of the field there is a necessary restriction in the depth of analysis of any one risk factor, or relations between them. As we only searched the PubMed database, it is possible that we may have missed relevant studies. We conducted a Supplementary Material (Appendix) is available online at www.thrombosis-online.com. Supplementary Material (Appendix) is available online at www.thrombosis-online.com. sensitivity analysis for the year 2013, and found no further eligible studies in EMBASE, which is consistent with other reports showing limited additional value of searching biomedical databases beyond PubMed ( 108 , 109 ). There are of course other publications in support of searching multiple databases to identify further studies ( 110 , 111 ). However, as we did not perform meta-analysis, we have not introduced any computational bias in to the present work and therefore consider our results and conclusions unlikely to change. Field synopses provide a systematic foundation, unbiased by a particular interest in one or more risk factors ( 112 ), for hypothesis generation and further research. One example of this would be to evaluate the extent to which the findings in relation to ethnicity, height and lipids ( 113 ) might be inter–related. A systematic evaluation of the available evidence suggests similarities as well as important differences in the risk factors for AF as compared with other cardiovascular diseases. This has implications for the primary prevention of AF.Out of 2777 publications, 73 were included (Suppl. Figure S1, Appendix p 4) with 84 reports on 32 cohorts from 10 countries and 20,420,175 participants ( 16 , 27–98 ). As ► Table 2 (available online at www.thrombosis-online.com ) shows, 28 (87.5 %) cohorts involved consented participants with 39,900 (6.9 %) events, and four cohorts (12.5 %) were EHR–based with 536,702 (93.1 %) events. AF events were ascertained from a research electrocardiogram (40 reports (47.6 %)), diagnosis codes from medical records (60 reports (71.4 %)), or using a combination of both methods (24 reports (28.6 %)). As Suppl. Table S1 (Appendix pp 5–7) shows, 17 reports (20.2 %) described using two out of four types of medical records (i. e. general practitioner, hospital care, prescriptions, or mortality records), but no report used three or all four types combined.Age range was not reported in 30 reports (35.7 %), mean or median follow–up in 18 reports (21.4 %), and risk factor definition was not reported in nine reports (10.7 %). Information was consistently reported on country, sample size, female participants, and AF events.Overall, 63 reports (75.0 %) lacked adjustment for all six standard CVD risk factors (Suppl. Table S2, Appendix pp 8–9). Age was adjusted for in 84 reports (100.0 %), sex in 80 reports (95.2 %), smoking in 49 reports (58.3 %), blood pressure in 63 reports (75.0 %), lipids in 32 reports (38.1 %), and diabetes mellitus in 59 reports (70.2 %). The total number of adjustment factors ranged from 2–14 factors, with a median of eight factors. There was lack of adjustment for prevalent CVD in 30 reports (35.7 %), and for incident CVD in 69 reports (82.1 %).A summary of the heterogeneity of associations of 23 risk factors and incidence of AF are visualised in ► Figure 1 , and for each factor separately in ► Figures 2–6 and Suppl. Figures S2–S19 (Appendix pp 12–29). There was no evidence of small study bias.For age, all 15 reports showed significant direct associations, but these were heterogeneous. RR ranged from 1.02 to 1.14 for every 1–year, from 1.43 to 1.65 for every 5–year, from 1.09 to 2.35 for every 10–year, and from 1.36 to 4.34 for every standard deviation (NR) year increase in age (Suppl. Figure S2 in Appendix) ( 28 , 32 , 35 , 37 , 43 , 47 , 50 , 55 , 67 , 70 , 88 , 90 , 94 , 98 ). For men (compared to women), one report showed a significant inverse association (0.70 ) ( 79 ), two reports were inverse but non-significant (from 0.95 to 0.96) ( 88 , 98 ), and eight reports showed significant direct associations (from 1.45 to 1.90 ) (Suppl. Figure S3 in Appendix) ( 37 , 43 , 47 , 50 , 55 , 70 , 94 ). For African-American, Asian, Chinese, Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Black (compared to White) ethnicities, all five reports showed significant inverse associations (from 0.35 to 0.84 ) ( 28 , 44 , 85 , 92 ). Only one country reported estimates for the association of ethnicity and incidence of AF (► Figure 2 ). For socio–economic status, two reports showed significant inverse associations, three reports were inverse but non-significant, and one report showed a mixed association (see Appendix p 10 and Suppl. Figure S4 for further details).For current smoking, one report was inverse but non-significant (0.78) ( 35 ), one report showed a mixed association ( 47 ), five reports were direct but non-significant (from 1.01 to 1.20) ( 54 , 56 , 70 , 83 , 88 ), and six reports showed significant direct associations (from 1.32 to 2.00 ) (Suppl. Figure S5 in Appendix, available online at www.thrombosis-online.com ) ( 28 , 37 , 40 , 47 , 78 , 79 ). For physical activity, three reports showed significant inverse associations, four reports were inverse but non-significant, two reports showed null or mixed associations, and two reports were direct but non-significant (see Appendix p 10 and Suppl. Figure S6). For alcohol intake in drinks per day or week, in grams per day or week, or for current alcohol drinkers, two reports showed significant inverse associations (from 0.65 to 0.96 ) ( 53 , 83 ), one report was inverse but non-significant (0.97) ( 46 ), one report showed a null association ( 28 ), three reports were direct but non-significant (from 1.04 to 1.20) ( 35 , 70 , 79 ), and three reports showed significant direct associations (from 1.39 to 2.90 ) ( 16 , 64 , 88 ). All 10 alcohol reports defined alcohol intake differently, and as shown for the three direct alcohol associations, the increased risk of developing AF was only among the highest alcohol intake categories (► Figure 3 ).For every 10–22 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure, or systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg, one report showed a null association ( 79 ), five reports were direct but non-significant (from 1.01 to 1.24) ( 35 , 47 , 55 , 83 , 84 ), and eight reports showed significant direct associations (from 1.14 to 2.63 ) (Suppl. Figure S7 in Appendix) ( 46 , 47 , 50 , 56 , 65 , 69 , 90 , 91 ). For every 10–11 mmHg increase in diastolic blood pressure, or diastolic blood pressure ≥95–100 mmHg, two reports showed signifitein cant inverse associations (from 0.87 to 0.92 ) ( 50 , 69 ), five reports were inverse but non-significant (from 0.82 to 0.99) ( 47 , 55 , 83 , 84 , 91 ), two reports were direct but non-significant (from 1.02 to 1.23) ( 47 , 65 ), and two reports showed significant direct associations (from 1.24 to 2.02 ) ( 46 , 90 ). No EHR cohorts reported estimates for the association of diastolic blood pressure and incidence of AF (► Figure 4 ). For hypertension, one report was inverse but non-significant (0.93) ( 88 ), three reports were direct but non-significant (from 1.21 to 1.37) ( 35 , 55 , 79 ), and 13 reports showed significant direct associations (from 1.28 to 2.60 ) (Suppl. Figure S8 in Appendix) ( 28 , 31 , 37 , 40 , 47 , 50 , 56 , 67 , 70 , 87 , 91 , 98 ).For every 10–50 mg/dl increase in total cholesterol, or total cholesterol ≥220–280 mg/dl, four reports showed significant inverse associations (from 0.76 to 0.94 ) ( 32 , 47 , 53 , 61 ), eight reports were inverse but non-significant (from 0.57 to 0.99) ( 35 , 41 , 47 , 56 , 67 , 71 , 83 , 88 ), and one report was direct but non-significant (1.13) ( 71 ). Both inverse and direct associations were shown in the three total cholesterol reports that adjusted for prevalent and incident CVD events (► Figure 5 ). For every 10–40 mg/dl increase in low–density lipoprotein cholesterol, or low–density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥150 mg/dl, two reports showed significant inverse associations (from 0.72 to 0.92 ) ( 32 , 61 ), four reports were inverse but non-significant (from 0.85 to 0.95) ( 41 , 55 , 71 , 83 ), and one report was direct but non-significant (1.15) (Suppl. Figure S9 in Appendix) ( 71 ). For every 15 mg/dl increase in high–density lipoprotein cholesterol, or high–density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥60mg/dl, five reports were inverse but non-significant (from 0.85 to 0.98) ( 32 , 47 , 71 ), two reports showed null or mixed associations ( 41 , 47 ), two reports were direct but non-significant (from 1.01 to 1.07) ( 61 , 83 ), and one report showed a significant direct association (1.16 ) (Suppl. Figure 10 in Appendix) ( 67 ). For triglycerides, three reports were inverse but non-significant, one report showed a mixed association, two reports were direct but non-significant, and three reports showed significant direct associations (see Appendix p 10 and Suppl. Figure S11).For diabetes mellitus (type unspecified), two reports were inverse but non-significant (from 0.86 to 0.98) ( 83 , 98 ), eight reports were direct but non-significant (from 1.02 to 1.49) ( 37 , 47 , 54 , 56 , 58 , 67 , 70 ), and six reports showed significant direct associations (from 1.17 to 1.80 ) (Suppl. Figure S12 in Appendix) ( 28 , 40 , 50 , 79 , 88 , 95 ). For renal function, three reports were inverse but non-significant, five reports were direct but non-significant, and three reports showed significant direct associations (see Appendix p 11 and Suppl. Figure S13).For every 1–10 cm increase in height, or height ≥173 cm, three reports were direct but non-significant (from 1.14 to 1.17) ( 47 , 67 , 70 ), and seven reports showed significant direct associations (from 1.03 to 1.92 ) ( 34 , 46 , 47 , 53 , 56 , 79 , 89 ) (► Figure 6 ). For weight, all eight reports showed significant direct associations (see Appendix p 11 and Suppl. Figure S14). For every 1–10 kg/m 2 increase in body mass index (BMI), or BMI ≥25–30 kg/m 2 , all 19 reports showed significant direct associations (from 1.04 to 2.24 ) (Suppl. Figure S15 in Appendix) ( 28 , 31 , 34 , 37 , 39 , 48 , 55 , 56 , 60 , 67 , 70 , 76 , 79 , 81 , 83 , 88–91 ).For C–reactive protein, four reports were direct but non-significant, and four reports showed significant direct associations (see Appendix p 11 and Suppl. Figure S16). For fibrinogen, two reports were inverse but non-significant, one report was direct but non-significant, and three reports showed significant direct associations (see Appendix p 11 and Suppl. Figure S17).For every 1.0 mU/l decrease in thyroid stimulating hormone, or thyroid stimulating hormone <0.10–0.45 mU/l, one report was inverse but non-significant (0.34) ( 82 ), five reports were direct but non-significant (from 1.06 to 2.85) ( 51 , 77 , 82 ), and two reports showed significant direct associations (from 1.41 to 3.10 ) (Suppl. Figure S18 in Appendix) ( 72 , 96 ). For autoimmune diseases, all three reports showed significant direct associations (see Appendix p 11 and Suppl. Figure S19).To our knowledge this is the first example of a field synopsis evaluating associations across multiple risk factors and disease incidence. We systematically evaluated 84 reports from 32 independent cohorts for the impact of 23 cardiovascular risk factors on incidence of AF. Unlike previous overviews of AF risk factors ( 10 , 99 ), we focussed exclusively on primary prevention among populations initially free from diagnosed CVD or general populations in which baseline levels of CVD reflected prevalence in the general population. We found some evidence that ethnicity, height, diastolic blood pressure and serum cholesterol, are associated with AF incidence in opposite directions to their known associations with CHD and stroke. Furthermore we found only modest evidence for the widely held clinical opinion that excess alcohol is associated with risk of AF. Taken together our findings suggest that primary prevention strategies for AF may require some different elements from the current approaches used for other CVDs.For some risk factors – hypertension, and higher BMI – there were consistent, direct associations with incident AF, as there are for CHD. This could reflect a causal link with AF, or that the risk factor causes CHD, which in turn causes AF. Surprisingly, we found that only three (out of 14) reports investigating the association between systolic blood pressure and incident AF accounted for both prevalent and intercurrent incident cardiovascular events, and only one of which reported a significant direct association. Several post-hoc analyses of trials have suggested a possible benefit of ACE/ARB–inhibitors ( 100 ), and other blood–pressure lowering medications ( 101 ), for prevention of AF. However, we demonstrate that across all 23 risk factors, the available observational evidence does not fully consider a mechanism or confounding of reported associations by intercurrent CHD. Current clinical guidelines include alcohol in a list of potentially “reversible” causes of AF, but acknowledge that there is no evidence to suggest addressing any of these is effective in preventing AF ( 9 ). We found a small number of reports (3 out of 10) suggesting a direct association between alcohol intake and AF incidence. This is in contrast to three existing alcohol reviews (Samokhvalov et al. ( 14 ), Kodama et al. ( 15 ) and Larsson et al. ( 16 )), which have reported dose–response relationships. There are several possible explanations as to why our findings differ. Unlike the previous alcohol reviews, ours considers i) only prospective studies (Samokhvalov et al. and Kodama et al. included retrospective studies; similarly Larsson et al. focused on prospective studies), ii) only general population cohorts (Larsson et al. included one cohort with pre-existing CVD), iii) only incident AF events (Kodama et al. included studies on AF recurrence), iv) only estimates from Cox or Poisson regression (Samokhvalov et al., Kodama et al., and Larsson et al. all included estimates from logistic regression), v) only the most adjusted alcohol estimate per cohort (Samokhvalov et al. included the study with the most comprehensive alcohol data, while Larsson et al. did not report an approach to selecting from multiple estimates per cohort), and lastly vi) our more recent review and more inclusive field synopsis method includes eight reports that have not been included in the previous reviews ( 28 , 35 , 46 , 53 , 70 , 79 , 83 , 88 ). Based on the three direct alcohol associations we identified, the increased risk of developing AF was confined to the highest alcohol intake levels, as opposed to there being a J–shaped or dose–response relationship. Overall, our findings indicate that at present, there is limited consistent evidence on which recommended alcohol intake levels for primary prevention of AF could be based.We found some evidence that white ethnicity, taller height, lower total cholesterol and lower diastolic blood pressure might confer a higher risk of incident AF, which is in the opposite direction to their known associations with incident CHD ( 12 ). Our findings regarding cholesterol suggest that reducing cholesterol may not be relevant for the primary prevention of AF, and are in line with an existing meta–analysis of trial evidence, which did not support the role of statins for prevention of AF in participants with underlying CVD ( 102 ). Previously, it been demonstrated that blood pressure has markedly different associations with the incidence of 12 individual cardiovascular diseases (not including AF) ( 103 ). We now provide some, albeit mixed, evidence that this may also be the case for AF. The direct and inverse associations shown for systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively, may indicate high pulse pressure, which is a marker of arterial stiffness and is more prevalent in older populations ( 104 ). Two earlier studies found an association between pulse pressure and incidence of AF ( 69 , 84 ); however, pulse pressure was not considered in this review as its clinical utility is not well defined ( 105 ).The observational evidence summarised here suggests that programmes for AF primary prevention may need to differ slightly from those which have guided clinicians and public health practitioners in the primary prevention of other CVDs. Existing management strategies to tackle obesity, smoking, alcohol and hypertension may have a role but the current evidence is insufficient to design AF specific interventions. The risk factors included in available prediction tools for 5- or 10-year risk of incident AF are supported by our systematic review, and these tools should be used more frequently in clinical practice ( 47 , 70 ). Such risk prediction tools could identify high–risk individuals for inclusion in primary prevention trials in AF, where there is the largest knowledge gap.Overall, we found a relatively “young” field, which has been rapidly expanding over the last five years (see Suppl. Figure S20, Appendix p 30). Although we included 32 cohorts of 20 million participants and 600,000 AF events, we found a limited number of reports (between 3 and 19) per risk factor. Although we identified some efforts at pooling studies (e. g. the CHARGE–AF consortium of 5 cohorts, 3 countries, and 1771 AF events (47)), the amount of evidence available is markedly smaller than the scale of cohort evidence available on risk factors for CHD or stroke incidence (e. g. The Emerging Risk Factor Collaboration consists of over 100 cohorts ( 106 )). Next, we found that the AF field is beginning to span both consented population and electronic health record studies, with all seven EHR reports published in 2011–2015. In the era of “big data” research, EHRs offer the potential for studying associations at much larger scale, at population–level, in comparison with other risk factors, and across a wide range of diseases ( 107 ). What is known about this topic? Atrial fibrillation is the world’s most common heart rhythm disorder, and leading cause of fatal and disabling strokes, yet current clinical practice guidelines offer no recommendations for primary prevention in individuals without pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Established primary prevention strategies of other cardiovascular diseases (e. g. coronary heart disease and stroke), are based on understanding of risk factors, but whether the same risk factors are associated with incident atrial fibrillation remains unclear. There is a lack of systematic reviews and field synopses of risk factors for atrial fibrillation among general populations and populations initially free from diagnosed CVD. What does this paper add? A systematic evaluation of evidence from 28 consented and four electronic health record cohorts confirms the importance of hypertension and obesity, but suggests important differences in the risk factors for incident atrial fibrillation as compared with other cardiovascular diseases. Non-white ethnicity, shorter height, higher cholesterol and higher diastolic blood pressure all showed some evidence of being associated with lower risk of incident AF. This contrasts with the known associations of these risk factors in the opposite direction with coronary heart disease. The evidence for the widely held clinical opinion that alcohol use is associated with incident AF in the primary preventative setting was modest. These findings provide a systematic basis on which to direct research into the primary prevention of AF. What is known about this topic?

The evidence for the widely held clinical opinion that alcohol use is associated with incident AF in the primary preventative setting was modest. These findings provide a systematic basis on which to direct research into the primary prevention of AF. None of the EHR cohorts analysed continuous measures of blood pressure, lipids, BMI, or renal function. Linking data from consented population and EHR sources therefore represents an important research opportunity to investigate risk factors for AF at depth and at scale. Finally, we found considerable heterogeneity in study design and reporting, and a lack of consistent approach to adjustment for other risk factors (visualised as a “Swiss cheese”). Field synopses allow for differences in study designs, however in order to further inform primary preventive programmes and estimate the precision effect of each risk factor in meta-analyses; there is a need for large–scale strategic co–ordination of the field of AF prevention research.The principle strength of our study – evaluation across a comprehensive range of risk factors – is also the principle weakness. In order to evaluate the breadth of the field there is a necessary restriction in the depth of analysis of any one risk factor, or relations between them. As we only searched the PubMed database, it is possible that we may have missed relevant studies. We conducted a Supplementary Material (Appendix) is available online at www.thrombosis-online.com. Supplementary Material (Appendix) is available online at www.thrombosis-online.com. sensitivity analysis for the year 2013, and found no further eligible studies in EMBASE, which is consistent with other reports showing limited additional value of searching biomedical databases beyond PubMed ( 108 , 109 ). There are of course other publications in support of searching multiple databases to identify further studies ( 110 , 111 ). However, as we did not perform meta-analysis, we have not introduced any computational bias in to the present work and therefore consider our results and conclusions unlikely to change. Field synopses provide a systematic foundation, unbiased by a particular interest in one or more risk factors ( 112 ), for hypothesis generation and further research. One example of this would be to evaluate the extent to which the findings in relation to ethnicity, height and lipids ( 113 ) might be inter–related.A systematic evaluation of the available evidence suggests similarities as well as important differences in the risk factors for AF as compared with other cardiovascular diseases. This has implications for the primary prevention of AF.',\n",

We aimed to determine and compare the accuracy of different methods for detecting pulse irregularities caused by atrial fibrillation. We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and LILACS until 16 March 2015. Two reviewers identified eligible studies, extracted data and appraised quality using the QUADAS-2 instrument. Meta-analysis, using the bivariate hierarchical random effects method, determined average operating points for sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative likelihood ratios (PLR, NLR); we constructed summary receiver operating characteristic plots. Twenty-one studies investigated 39 interventions (n = 15,129 pulse assessments) for detecting atrial fibrillation. Compared to 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) diagnosed atrial fibrillation, blood pressure monitors (BPMs; seven interventions) and non-12-lead ECGs (20 interventions) had the greatest accuracy for detecting pulse irregularities attributable to atrial fibrillation (BPM: sensitivity 0.98 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92\\u20131.00), specificity 0.92 (95% CI 0.88\\u20130.95), PLR 12.1 (95% CI 8.2\\u201317.8) and NLR 0.02 (95% CI 0.00\\u20130.09); non-12-lead ECG: sensitivity 0.91 (95% CI 0.86\\u20130.94), specificity 0.95 (95% CI 0.92\\u20130.97), PLR 20.1 (95% CI 12\\u201333.7), NLR 0.09 (95% CI 0.06\\u20130.14)). There were similar findings for smartphone applications (six interventions) although these studies were small in size. The sensitivity and specificity of pulse palpation (six interventions) were 0.92 (95% CI 0.85\\u20130.96) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.76\\u20130.88), respectively (PLR 5.2 (95% CI 3.8\\u20137.2), NLR 0.1 (95% CI 0.05\\u20130.18)). BPMs and non-12-lead ECG were most accurate for detecting pulse irregularities caused by atrial fibrillation; other technologies may therefore be pragmatic alternatives to pulse palpation for the first step of atrial fibrillation screening.\", \"article_text\": \"Atrial fibrillation (AF) has a prevalence that increases with age. 1 , 2 AF is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, most notably from its associated four to fivefold increased risk of ischaemic stroke, 3 and poses a significant public health burden. 4 The SAFE trial was the largest randomised study of AF screening in primary care and found this to be an effective method for increasing AF detection when compared to routine practice. 5 , 6 Combined with the subsequent provision of antithrombotic therapy, 7 , 8 screening is likely to reduce thromboembolic complications from AF 9 and, consequently, this has been proposed to improve AF. 10 , 11 AF screening is a two-stage process. Firstly, asymptomatic patients with irregular pulses are identified and then AF is confirmed or excluded using 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG). 8 , 10 The accuracy with which irregular pulses are caused by AF is important; a high false positive rate would result in many patients having unnecessary ECG examinations, whereas a high false negative rate could mean excessive AF diagnoses are missed. The SAFE trial used opportunistic pulse palpation to identify patients over 65 years of age with an irregular pulse. Although this approach was found to be effective, no other methods for identifying irregular pulses have been tested in trials of AF screening. Pulse palpation may not be the optimal \\u2018first step\\u2019 in identifying patients with suspected AF and using modified blood pressure (BP) monitors, pulse oximetry or non-12-lead ECG devices, for example, could improve the process of screening. 12 Despite pulse palpation being a cheap method for detecting AF, this results in high false positive cases of suspected AF and it may be possible to improve the accuracy of identifying patients with suspected AF using alternative methods. This systematic review aimed to provide evidence to underpin the first stage of AF screening by describing and comparing the diagnostic accuracies of methods for identifying patients with irregular pulses caused by AF.This study was conducted in accordance with guidelines and methods for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of diagnostic tests. 13 \\u2013 16 We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL) and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Information System (LILACS) in all languages published until 16 March 2015 (Appendix 1). In addition, the reference lists of national guidelines, review articles and included studies were hand-searched to identify eligible studies. All randomised trials and observational studies, with the exclusion of case reports and case series, which recruited participants \\u226518 years of age, investigated any method of identifying patients with an irregular pulse or suspected AF (the index test) and compared the index test with any ECG interpreted by a competent professional (the reference standard), involved healthcare professionals identifying patients with an irregular pulse, and reported sufficient data to enable calculation of diagnostic accuracy were included. Studies that investigated invasive or echocardiographic methods of identifying AF were excluded. After the removal of duplicate records, two reviewers (JT and MJ) independently screened citations for relevance and reviewed full-text articles using predetermined eligibility criteria. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus with a third reviewer (TC). Data were independently extracted using a prespecified data extraction form by two reviewers (JT and MJ). Any disagreements were resolved by consensus with a third reviewer (TC). When studies reported findings using multiple thresholds for the same intervention, only data in which thresholds maximised the sensitivity of the index test were extracted in order to avoid duplicate inclusion of the same index test. The lead authors of studies for which there were insufficient data for calculation of diagnostic accuracy were contacted to ascertain missing data; studies were only excluded if no additional data were identified or if the authors failed to respond. Study quality was appraised using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies-2 (QUADAS-2) instrument. 15 , 17 In addition, the studies were graded using the quality scale reported by Van den Bruel et al.; 18 studies were rated as grade A if they fulfilled all QUADAS-2 criteria. Studies were graded D if there was no or unclear verification of the index test findings with the reference standard, or if the index test results were interpreted unblinded to the results of the reference test. Studies in which there was an unduly long time delay between index and reference tests, or the reference test was not independent of the index test, or the reference test was interpreted unblinded to the results of the index test were graded C. The remaining studies that did not fall into these categories were graded B. We constructed 2 \\u00d7 2 contingency tables to enable calculation of the sensitivity and specificity of each method for identifying patients with suspected AF. Meta-analysis, using the bivariate hierarchical random effects method, was used to determine the average operating points for sensitivity and specificity, and enabled the construction of summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) plots with 95% prediction regions. We also calculated positive and negative likelihood ratios (PLR and NLR) for each detection method. Unlike sensitivity and specificity, likelihood ratios make explicit the impact of the test result on the probability of disease. To minimise heterogeneity we analysed the results a priori in groups of each method for identifying an irregular pulse. Subgroup analyses were planned according to study quality and studies conducted in primary care providing there were four or more studies within subgroups. Heterogeneity is presumed in meta-analyses of diagnostic test studies and the I 2 statistic cannot be reliably used for its assessment. 16 We therefore described any variation in the outcomes from included studies and our pooled estimates by visual inspection of the SROC plots and how close individual studies lie to the predicted receiver operating characteristic curve. 16 Publication bias was assessed within categories of method for detecting AF using Deeks\\u2019 funnel plot asymmetry test; a P value less than 0.10 was used to signify the presence of publication bias. Analyses were conducted using Stata version 11.0 and Review Manager 5.2 for quality assessments.This study was conducted in accordance with guidelines and methods for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of diagnostic tests. 13 \\u2013 16 We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL) and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Information System (LILACS) in all languages published until 16 March 2015 (Appendix 1). In addition, the reference lists of national guidelines, review articles and included studies were hand-searched to identify eligible studies. All randomised trials and observational studies, with the exclusion of case reports and case series, which recruited participants \\u226518 years of age, investigated any method of identifying patients with an irregular pulse or suspected AF (the index test) and compared the index test with any ECG interpreted by a competent professional (the reference standard), involved healthcare professionals identifying patients with an irregular pulse, and reported sufficient data to enable calculation of diagnostic accuracy were included. Studies that investigated invasive or echocardiographic methods of identifying AF were excluded. After the removal of duplicate records, two reviewers (JT and MJ) independently screened citations for relevance and reviewed full-text articles using predetermined eligibility criteria. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus with a third reviewer (TC).Data were independently extracted using a prespecified data extraction form by two reviewers (JT and MJ). Any disagreements were resolved by consensus with a third reviewer (TC). When studies reported findings using multiple thresholds for the same intervention, only data in which thresholds maximised the sensitivity of the index test were extracted in order to avoid duplicate inclusion of the same index test. The lead authors of studies for which there were insufficient data for calculation of diagnostic accuracy were contacted to ascertain missing data; studies were only excluded if no additional data were identified or if the authors failed to respond. Study quality was appraised using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies-2 (QUADAS-2) instrument. 15 , 17 In addition, the studies were graded using the quality scale reported by Van den Bruel et al.; 18 studies were rated as grade A if they fulfilled all QUADAS-2 criteria. Studies were graded D if there was no or unclear verification of the index test findings with the reference standard, or if the index test results were interpreted unblinded to the results of the reference test. Studies in which there was an unduly long time delay between index and reference tests, or the reference test was not independent of the index test, or the reference test was interpreted unblinded to the results of the index test were graded C.

From these, 69 were identified for detailed evaluation ( Figure 1 ). After full-text review, 21 studies were included in the final analyses (Appendix 2). 9 , 19 \\u2013 38 Five studies met the selection criteria, but reported insufficient outcome data and were excluded (Appendix 3). 39 \\u2013 43 Figure 1. Study selection and stratification. Study selection and stratification. Of the 21 studies included (Appendix 2), there were two randomised trials, 9 , 30 seven case\\u2013control, 20 , 21 , 26 , 32 \\u2013 35 two cohort 24 , 38 and 10 cross-sectional 19 , 22 , 23 , 25 , 27 \\u2013 29 , 31 , 36 , 37 studies. The 21 studies investigated 39 interventions (n = 15,129 pulse assessments), which were categorised as blood pressure monitors (BPMs) (six studies; seven interventions), 25 , 28 , 33 , 36 \\u2013 38 non-12-lead ECG (10 studies; 20 interventions), 9 , 19 \\u2013 22 , 24 , 25 , 31 , 32 , 35 pulse palpation (six studies; six interventions) 9 , 25 , 27 , 30 , 32 , 34 and smartphone applications (three studies; six interventions). 23 , 26 , 29 The five studies that were excluded due to insufficient reporting of outcome data investigated pulse palpation, pulse oximetry, smartphone applications and single-lead ECG as methods for detecting AF. Although the majority of studies avoided a case\\u2013controlled design, only four were prospective and seven studies were conducted in a primary care setting. 9 , 25 , 27 , 30 , 32 , 34 , 35 AF prevalence ranged from 5.7% to 25.4% in studies with a prospective design. 9 , 24 , 30 , 38 There was substantial variation in the proportion and/or prevalence of AF in studies within each category of detection method. Five studies excluded participants if they were less than 65 years of age and for two studies age of inclusion was 75 years. 9 , 25 , 27 , 32 \\u2013 34 , 38 Six studies included participants who were 18 years or older. 24 , 28 \\u2013 31 , 36 Ten studies excluded patients that had been fitted with pacemakers and/or implantable defibrillators. 22 , 25 , 27 , 28 , 33 , 35 \\u2013 38 For the majority of studies, the reference standard was 12-lead ECG interpreted by at least one trained physician/cardiologist. One study did not specify the training of the clinician interpreting reference ECGs. 19 Five studies reported other reference standards; 27 , 29 , 30 , 34 , 38 one study used either 12-lead ECG or ECGs derived from cardiac telemetry; 29 three studies used single or limb-lead ECG; 27 , 30 , 34 one study used ECGs derived from Holter monitors. 38 The methodological quality of included studies using QUADAS-2 criteria is presented in Figure 2 . Study quality was generally low. Using the additional quality grading system, we classified one study as A grade having met all QUADAS-2 criteria. 30 Eleven studies were graded category C or D. 9 , 19 , 21 \\u2013 23 , 27 , 29 , 32 \\u2013 34 , 36 Studies with the lowest methodological quality (D grade) were classified as this due to either the interpretation of the reference standard being unclear or at high risk of bias, or due to the index test being interpreted unblinded to the results of the reference standard. Category C studies were graded as such because it was unclear whether there was an appropriate time interval between the index test and reference standard. The remaining nine studies were categorised as grade B in methodological quality. 20 , 24 \\u2013 26 , 28 , 31 , 35 , 37 , 38 Figure 2. Study quality according to QUADAS-2 criteria. Study quality according to QUADAS-2 criteria. Forest plots for diagnostic accuracies of the four methods for detecting AF are presented (Appendices 4\\u20137). BPMs had a pooled sensitivity of 0.98 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92\\u20131) and specificity of 0.92 (95% CI 0.88\\u20130.95); PLR of 12.1 (95% CI 8.2\\u201317.8) and NLR of 0.02 (95% CI 0.00\\u20130.09). There were similar diagnostic accuracies for studies that investigated smartphone applications, sensitivity 0.97 (95% CI 0.95\\u20130.99), specificity 0.95 (95% CI 0.88\\u20130.98), PLR 19 (95% CI 8\\u201345), NLR 0.03 (95% CI 0.01\\u20130.05); and non-12-lead ECGs, sensitivity 0.91 (95% CI 0.86\\u20130.94), specificity 0.95 (95% CI 0.92\\u20130.97), PLR 20.1 (95% CI 12\\u201333.7), NLR 0.09 (95% CI 0.06\\u20130.14). Although pulse palpation had a sensitivity that was comparable to the other methods for detecting suspected AF (sensitivity of 0.92; 95% CI 0.85\\u20130.96), there was a substantially lower specificity for this method (specificity 0.82; 95% CI 0.76\\u20130.88); PLR and NLR for pulse palpation were 5.2 (95% CI 3.8\\u20137.2) and 0.1 (95% CI 0.05\\u20130.18), respectively. SROC plots for the methods of detecting AF are presented in Figure 3 . Visual inspection of the plots confirms the accuracy of pulse palpation was lower than other methods for detecting AF. There was substantial variation in outcomes of the studies investigating non-12-lead ECG from the predicted receiver operating characteristic curve and suggests the heterogeneity among these studies was greatest. In contrast, the heterogeneity was lowest among studies that investigated smartphone applications for detecting AF. Figure 3.

There were only sufficient studies to perform bivariate subgroup analyses according to study quality for BPM, non-12-lead ECG and pulse palpation interventions. After the exclusion of studies with the lowest (D grade) quality, there were no substantial differences to the primary findings.

Sufficient studies to perform bivariate subgroup analyses for primary care studies were available for pulse palpation and non-12-lead ECG interventions. The findings were similar to our primary analyses, although the specificity of non-12-lead ECGs was slightly lower (non-12-lead ECGs: sensitivity 0.91 (95% CI 0.83\\u20130.95), specificity 0.89 (95% CI 0.85\\u20130.92); pulse palpation: all studies were conducted in primary care and findings already presented above).Of the 21 studies included (Appendix 2), there were two randomised trials, 9 , 30 seven case\\u2013control, 20 , 21 , 26 , 32 \\u2013 35 two cohort 24 , 38 and 10 cross-sectional 19 , 22 , 23 , 25 , 27 \\u2013 29 , 31 , 36 , 37 studies.

Although the sensitivities of all methods for identifying those with AF were similar, the specificity of pulse palpation was substantially lower, which gives rise to more false positive test results. This study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of interventions for detecting suspected AF. A strength was the use of a protocol, consistent with guidelines for systematic reviews of diagnostic test studies. We used a comprehensive search strategy and our findings supported the lack of publication bias. It is therefore likely that we included small studies with less significant findings. Five studies were excluded from meta-analyses due to insufficient reporting of outcome data; outcomes that were reported from these studies were consistent with our pooled findings and the effect of their exclusion is likely to be minimal. Only four of the 21 included studies were prospective and there were a number of methodological weaknesses in most studies, as reflected by our assessments of study quality; only one study was judged to fulfil all QUADAS-2 criteria. Most studies were conducted in a secondary care setting and there was substantial variation in the proportion of patients with AF. This limits the generalisability of our findings to primary care populations that AF screening is intended for. As expected, there was heterogeneity among studies within all intervention categories and this is likely to be attributable to differences in study populations and design. Variation was greatest for studies investigating non-12-lead ECG for detecting AF. This may be due to differences in detection methods within this category as non-12-lead ECG interventions included single-lead, three-lead and reconstructed ECG. Furthermore, difference in healthcare professionals used to interpret ECGs is also likely to contribute to the heterogeneity within this intervention category. Guidance recommends pulse palpation as the first step for AF screening. 10 , 11 This method of identifying those with an irregular pulse was evaluated as part of two randomised trials in primary care; combined with confirmatory 12-lead ECG for diagnosing AF; these studies suggest this is an efficacious and cost-effective approach to screening. 9 , 30 More recently, studies have tended to evaluate alternative screening technologies. Our review identified four methods (non-12-lead ECG, BPMs, smartphone applications and pulse oximetry) as alternative methods for detecting pulse irregularities, although the latter method was not eligible for inclusion in our analyses. Of all interventions, pulse palpation had the lowest diagnostic accuracy for detecting pulse irregularities caused by AF, as reflected by its lower specificity. This could be due to differences in the threshold of each method to rule in or out AF; electronic methods, such as BPMs, use software algorithms to determine the severity of pulse irregularity and only those patients meeting a predetermined cut-off point are classified as having AF. In contrast, studies investigating pulse palpation required clinicians to classify the pulse as being regular or irregular. It is therefore conceivable that pulse palpation could result in greater false positive cases of suspected AF due to patients with transient pulse irregularities (e.g. ventricular extra-systoles) being referred for ECG testing, which software algorithms would have excluded. Although pulse palpation is considered a cheap and feasible method for detecting patients with an irregular pulse, 12 our review highlights the potential for alternative technologies to improve the identification of those with suspected AF. Any method of detecting pulse irregularities caused by AF should, in addition to being cheap, be quick, simple and accurate for it to be a cost-effective intervention in primary care. Recent guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advocates the use of automated BPMs for the detection of suspected AF in patients being screened or monitored for hypertension. 44 We found BPMs to have a substantially greater accuracy for detecting pulse irregularities caused by AF than pulse palpation; such devices are likely to be pragmatic alternatives to pulse palpation as blood pressure checks are an integral component of existing cardiovascular screening programmes in primary care. 45 Furthermore, automated devices would enable screening to be conducted by all healthcare professionals without the need for additional training. However, to date there have been no economic analyses comparing BPMs to pulse palpation for detecting suspected AF and this would help to inform optimal planning and service configurations of any future AF screening programme. Our review highlights the potential of smartphone applications for detecting suspected AF. This method had a similar diagnostic accuracy as BPMs. However, only three studies investigated this detection modality; two of these investigated multiple software algorithms in the same cohort of patients and all studies were small in sample size. This is likely to inflate our estimates of diagnostic accuracy for smartphone applications, and our findings should be interpreted with caution. However, if these findings are replicated in larger studies that represent those targeted by screening, this raises the possibility of using such technologies within both the clinic and home settings. The second stage of AF screening is diagnosing AF in patients with an irregular pulse. The gold standard test for diagnosing AF is 12-lead ECG interpreted by a competent professional. 8 , 11 The range and accuracies of methods for diagnosing AF using 12-lead ECG is not known. Indeed, optimising the accuracy of both stages to AF screening will help ensure the effectiveness of this intervention and planning of appropriate service configuration for delivering screening.This study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of interventions for detecting suspected AF.

Newer technologies may therefore be a pragmatic alternative to pulse palpation for identifying patients with suspected AF as part of national screening programmes.\", \"citation_tuples\": [[\"11602543\", \"pmid\"], [\"17679673\", \"pmid\"], [\"14966048\", \"pmid\"], [\"23633374\", \"pmid\"], [\"17577005\", \"pmid\"], [\"22922413\", \"pmid\"], [\"22518390\", \"pmid\"], [\"22007046\", \"pmid\"], [\"152709\", \"pmid\"], [\"19096977\", \"pmid\"], [\"18817921\", \"pmid\"], [\"24687081\", \"pmid\"], [\"22198902\", \"pmid\"], [\"23220686\", \"pmid\"], [\"12014534\", \"pmid\"], [\"23252002\", \"pmid\"], [\"11050790\", \"pmid\"], [\"19279661\", \"pmid\"], [\"24913608\", \"pmid\"], [\"15125721\", \"pmid\"], [\"19478793\", \"pmid\"], [\"23499278\", \"pmid\"], [\"21401988\", \"pmid\"]]}\n"
