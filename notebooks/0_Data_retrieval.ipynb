      "      <p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of arrhythmia reported in clinical practice. As this condition is associated with an increased risk of major complications, such as thrombosis and stroke, finding optimal therapies for AF has long been a topic of interest among clinicians. Although the Cox Maze III procedure has been considered the gold standard for the surgical treatment of AF since 1991, [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref001\">1</xref>] it has not been used extensively due to its complexity and invasive character. Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), the standard catheter ablation procedure for paroxysmal AF (PrAF), has success rates exceeding 70% and acceptable complication rates [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref002\">2</xref>]. However, neither epicardial ablation nor endocardial ablation alone can achieve a satisfactory result in patients with long-standing persistent AF (LSPsAF), making these patients prone to multiple repeat procedures and complications related to excessive atrial ablation. In recent years, surgeons have combined minimally invasive thoracoscopic surgery and percutaneous catheter ablation, creating a new procedure known as hybrid ablation, in an attempt to improve success rates and curb complication rates. A few systematic reviews have summarized the existing literature, focusing on aspects such as strategies for patient selection, periprocedural anticoagulation regimens, and ablation techniques [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref003\">3</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref004\">4</xref>]. However, the efficacy and safety of the hybrid ablation procedure have not been sufficiently studied. Factors that can influence the success rates and the incidence of perioperative complications are yet to be determined. To this end, we performed a pooled analysis and meta-analysis of data from existing studies and trials.</p>\n",

Average history of atrial fibrillation was (5.0±1.6) years. The pooled proportion of patients who were arrhythmia-free at the primary endpoint was 73% (95% CI, 64%–81%, Cochran’s Q, P&lt;0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 81%). The pooled rate of severe short-term complications was 4% (95% CI, 2%–7%, Cochran’s Q, P = 0.01; I<sup>2</sup> = 51%). The success rate after one-step procedures (69%) was lower than that after staged procedures (78%). The staged approach could ultimately prove to be safer, although complication rates were relatively low for both approaches (2% and 5%, respectively).</p>\n",

      "      <p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of arrhythmia reported in clinical practice. As this condition is associated with an increased risk of major complications, such as thrombosis and stroke, finding optimal therapies for AF has long been a topic of interest among clinicians. Although the Cox Maze III procedure has been considered the gold standard for the surgical treatment of AF since 1991, [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref001\">1</xref>] it has not been used extensively due to its complexity and invasive character. Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), the standard catheter ablation procedure for paroxysmal AF (PrAF), has success rates exceeding 70% and acceptable complication rates [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref002\">2</xref>]. However, neither epicardial ablation nor endocardial ablation alone can achieve a satisfactory result in patients with long-standing persistent AF (LSPsAF), making these patients prone to multiple repeat procedures and complications related to excessive atrial ablation. In recent years, surgeons have combined minimally invasive thoracoscopic surgery and percutaneous catheter ablation, creating a new procedure known as hybrid ablation, in an attempt to improve success rates and curb complication rates. A few systematic reviews have summarized the existing literature, focusing on aspects such as strategies for patient selection, periprocedural anticoagulation regimens, and ablation techniques [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref003\">3</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref004\">4</xref>]. However, the efficacy and safety of the hybrid ablation procedure have not been sufficiently studied. Factors that can influence the success rates and the incidence of perioperative complications are yet to be determined. To this end, we performed a pooled analysis and meta-analysis of data from existing studies and trials.</p>\n",

We ran searches using EMBASE (1947–Oct. 2017) (<xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"pone.0190170.s003\">S2 File</xref>), MEDLINE (1950–Oct. 2017) (<xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"pone.0190170.s004\">S3 File</xref>), and the Cochrane library. Two authors (first and second author) independently reviewed all articles. The primary endpoint was defined as no episode of AF or atrial tachycardia longer than 30 seconds without administration of antiarrhythmic drugs. We selected only prospective studies in which all subjects in the treatment group underwent both epicardial and endocardial ablation, either simultaneously or separately. Additionally, the follow-up methods and results, including the number of patients who were arrhythmia-free at the end of the follow-up period, had to be clearly described. Studies were excluded if they did not distinctly report the follow-up outcomes or if they reported that epicardial ablation was performed by sternotomy. When several studies covered overlapping data, we chose the study including the greatest number of patients. The corresponding author made the final decision when the fist and the second author disagreed regarding the inclusion of an article or extracted data. The data were registered into a Microsoft Excel Office 2011 spread sheet.</p>\n",

Questions concerning control groups were excluded from the scale. Cohort studies were assessed using the original NOS scale. The first three questions assessed selection of the study population and representativeness of the study groups (age of patients, types and duration of AF). The following two questions evaluated how the studies determined exposure and assessed evidence that no similar procedures were previously performed. The remaining three points were awarded for outcome quality (Holter monitoring lasting at least 7 days as proof of sinus rhythm; SR), duration of follow-up (at least 12 months), and bias due to dropout or incomplete follow-up. A score of 5 or lower indicated a low-quality cohort study, while a score of 3 or lower was a marker of poor quality for single-arm trials.</p>\n",

Although several traditional reviews and a few systematic reviews have discussed hybrid ablation, to date, this is the first meta-analysis focusing on the safety and efficacy of this novel procedure. We conducted a review of the relevant literature, which consisted mostly of observational studies, as anticipated. We analyzed the success rates and complication rates in the 16 studies we ultimately selected for inclusion. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were also conducted.</p>\n",

      "          <p>In the 16 included studies, 82.7% (551/666) of patients were in sinus rhythm at the end of the follow-up period. The pooled proportion of patients in SR without administration of AADs was 73%. This was higher than the success rate (66%) previously reported in a systematic review that simply obtained an average of the SR rates in multiple studies. The pooled success rate with AADs or repeat catheter ablation(s) was 83%, which was also higher than the 78% rate reported in the aforementioned systematic review [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref004\">4</xref>]. This difference could be attributed to the superiority of meta-analyses in summarizing scientific results. Certain differences in article selection could also explain the discrepancy between the success rates. Trials conducted in different periods of time by the same researcher were included in our study, but excluded from the review article by Vroomen et al [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref004\">4</xref>]. Meanwhile, we excluded some articles with a high risk of overlap between study populations.</p>\n",
      "          <p>Few studies have directly compared the success rates of hybrid ablation to those of other therapies. Mahapatra et al [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref010\">10</xref>] matched 15 consecutive patients who underwent hybrid ablation to 30 patients who underwent a repeat CA. After a follow-up of (20.7 ± 4.5) months, 13/15 (86.7%) patients were free from AF and off AADs after hybrid ablation, while the proportion of patients without arrhythmia and off AADs after repeat CA was only 16/30 (53.3%). This study demonstrated higher success rates after hybrid ablation compared with a repeat CA, suggesting that hybrid ablation could represent a last-resort therapy for patients with LSPsAF or other indicators of an unfavorable prognosis, such as previously failed CA.</p>\n",
      "          <p>Lesion transmurality is crucial for achieving complete and durable PVI. A variety of energy sources, including RF, microwave, laser, high frequency ultrasound, and cryothermy, have been used for the ablation of AF [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref018\">18</xref>]. Experimental animal models [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref002\">2</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref018\">18</xref>] have shown that surgical ablation using bipolar RF clamps is the most reliable method of creating circumferential transmural lesions in the pulmonary veins. Clinical trials have confirmed this result. In a review article, the success rate ranged from 85.7% to 92% in studies employing bipolar RF energy and from 36.8% to 88.9% in those utilizing unipolar RF energy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref019\">19</xref>]. Our meta-analysis reached similar conclusions. The pooled proportion of patients in SR was 84% after bipolar ablation and 67% after unipolar RF ablation.</p>\n",
      "          <p>Patients who had undergone previous CA had a lower treatment success rate (74%) than those who had not (87%). This discrepancy could be explained by the fact that previously failed ablation is suggestive of challenging cases with a stronger tendency for PV reconnection after ablation and an atrial substrate that promotes AF maintenance. The mechanisms of AF recurrence might be different in these patients [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref020\">20</xref>].</p>\n",

      "          <p>Patient safety has always been a top priority for cardiac surgeons and electrophysiologists. The hybrid ablation procedure was designed to decrease the high rate of complications associated with the traditional cut-and-sew method, while ensuring a relatively high success rate. The overall rate of short-term severe complications in our meta-analysis was 4%. This was lower than the rate previously reported by Boersma et al [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref021\">21</xref>] (9.8%) and Pokushalov et al [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref022\">22</xref>] (25%) in epicardial only (mini-maze) ablation procedures, but comparable to the 3.6% rate reported by Wang et al [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref023\">23</xref>]. As complications associated with hybrid ablation are reportedly mostly surgery-related, it is safe to conclude that the rate of severe complications associated with this procedure is no higher than the complication rate of stand-alone thoracoscopic surgical ablation. Although several authors reported no complications associated with the hybrid procedure in small to medium-sized population samples [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref010\">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref024\">24</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref026\">26</xref>], avoiding certain life-threatening complications remains a challenge for clinicians.</p>\n",
      "          <p>Atrial-esophageal fistula is a rare but life-threatening condition, which can be difficult to diagnose and can lead to death despite active treatment. Both Kiser et al [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref027\">27</xref>] (two cases) and Gehi et al [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref009\">9</xref>] (one case) reported the occurrence of atrial-esophageal fistulas and death after the use of the transdiaphragmatic surgical approach. Unipolar RF was the energy source for epicardial ablation in both of these studies. This complication could be attributed to the fact that bipolar RF clamps direct the ablation energy exclusively toward the pulmonary veins, while unipolar devices inevitably expose the esophagus to heat radiation during the ablation.</p>\n",
      "          <p>Currently, RF ablation can be performed by either a thoracoscopic or a transdiaphragmatic approach. Given the nature of epicardial ablation, the possibility of perioperative cardiac tamponade is low, since the pericardium is open during the surgical procedure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref011\">11</xref>]. Only one case of cardiac tamponade was reported (on day 24 after surgery) across the 11 studies that adopted the thoracoscopic approach in epicardial ablation. The five studies (n = 356) that adopted the transdiaphragmatic approach reported five cases of cardiac tamponade. The incidence of this complication across the five studies was 1.4% (5/356), suggesting that the transdiaphragmatic approach could carry a higher risk of cardiac tamponade. Further investigation is needed to identify the underlying causes.</p>\n",
      "          <p>Excision or ligation of the LAA during the procedure did not seem to influence the perioperative complication rate (4% with ligation vs. 5% with untouched LAA), although these steps can theoretically increase the odds of short-term hemorrhagic complications. Routine excision of the LAA during hybrid ablation procedures appears to be relatively safe.</p>\n",
      "          <p>As surgical centers continue to adopt hybrid ablation as a treatment option for persistent AF, safety remains the primary focus of clinicians. It is unreasonable to expose patients to a high risk of surgical complications, especially since hybrid ablation was designed to avoid the risks associated with open heart surgery. Further research is necessary to identify the best means of avoiding severe complications.</p>\n",

      "        <p>By definition, the hybrid procedure combines thoracoscopic epicardial ablation with a catheter ablation procedure. However, whether a two-step procedure is superior to a one-step approach is yet to be determined. The subgroup analysis showed that the pooled success rate at the primary endpoint was lower after one-step procedures (69%) than after staged procedures (78%). The blanking period following PVI, during which the epicardial lesions mature and stabilize, may have contributed to this difference in outcomes. Reimbursement issues also played a role in the choice of procedure, as in some cases surgical decisions were shaped by reimbursement policies rather than medical considerations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref008\">8</xref>]. Safety outcomes favor the staged approach (2%), although the complication rates are relatively low with both approaches (2% vs. 5%). Administration of anticoagulants (heparin) during CA can theoretically lead to higher incidence of hemorrhagic complications. Prolonged procedural time is a risk factor for complications as well. Although it can be partly attributed to the learning curve of surgical teams, the 2%-5% complication rate is still far from satisfactory. Further refinement of surgical techniques is necessary. The current data suggest that staged hybrid ablation could be the optimal approach, due to its higher success rate and a seemingly lower complication rate.</p>\n",

De Asmundis et al [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref028\">28</xref>] reported that conversion to SR during ablation did not improve clinical outcomes after an average follow-up time of 19 months (<italic>P</italic> = 0.47).

       "'In contemporary atrial fibrillation trials most deaths are cardiac related, whereas stroke and bleeding represent only a small subset of deaths. We aimed to evaluate the long-term risk of cardiac events and all-cause mortality in individuals with atrial fibrillation compared to no atrial fibrillation.A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published between 1 January 2006 and 21 October 2016.Four databases were searched. Studies had follow-up of at least 500 stable patients for either cardiac endpoints or all-cause mortality for 12 months or longer. Publication bias was evaluated and random effects models were used to synthesise the results. Heterogeneity between studies was examined by subgroup and meta-regression analyses.A total of 15 cohort studies was included. Analyses indicated that atrial fibrillation was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (relative risk (RR) 1.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26–1.85), all-cause mortality (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.50–2.54) and heart failure (RR 4.62, 95% CI 3.13–6.83). Coronary heart disease at baseline was associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction and explained 57% of the heterogeneity. A prospective cohort design accounted for 25% of all-cause mortality heterogeneity. Due to there being fewer than 10 studies, sources of heterogeneity were inconclusive for heart failure.Atrial fibrillation seems to be associated with an increased risk of subsequent myocardial infarction in patients without coronary heart disease and an increased risk of, all-cause mortality and heart failure in patients with and without coronary heart disease.Current treatment of thromboembolic complications associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) has mainly focused on the prevention of stroke. 1 , 2  Notwithstanding, patients with AF frequently develop coronary heart disease (CHD). Similar cardiovascular risk factors for CHD and AF have been suggested to reflect a common pathway of underlying vascular disease. 3In a recent meta-analysis of patients with AF, cardiac deaths accounted for 46% of all deaths during follow-up, whereas non-haemorrhagic stroke/systemic embolism and haemorrhage-related deaths represented only 5.7% and 5.6% of the total mortality, respectively. 4  As part of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, 5  including participants free of CHD at baseline, AF was associated with a 63% increased risk of incident myocardial infarction (MI). These studies limited inclusion to either AF-only or CHD-free patients.The objective of the present systematic review was therefore to summarise the evidence from contemporary epidemiological studies, which included patients with predominantly sinus rhythm with or without CHD at baseline, examining the association between AF and the risk of major cardiac events (CEs) and mortality, followed by an evaluation of the influence of core patient-level characteristics such as age, gender and CHD at baseline.The review protocol has been registered at  http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/  (reg. CRD42016033209). The manuscript was prepared according to the 2009 PRISMA checklist. 6We selected randomised trials or observational studies of clinically stable patients that evaluated MI, heart failure (HF) and mortality as endpoints in AF patients versus patients without AF; both categories with or without preceding CHD.To reflect contemporary management in view of the large differences in risk and outcome as compared to earlier management strategies 7  we considered articles published between 1 January 2006 and 21 October 2016.In order to minimise the problems associated with small-scale studies, at least 500 participants who were haemodynamically stable on inclusion and followed for 12 months or longer were required. As the unfavourable prognosis of AF complicating an acute MI 8  and cardiac surgery 9  is well established, studies selected had to have included patients who had sustained an MI or coronary artery bypass graft operation (CABG) more than 30 days prior to inclusion. Studies recruiting patients with acute AF at baseline were excluded, as were outcome studies comparing the prognostic impact of rate versus rhythm control in AF patients.We searched the databases Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library and Pubmed (including articles published ahead of print). Our search strategy combined text words and subject headings, with details presented in Supplementary Appendix 1.Two investigators independently evaluated studies for eligibility. Discrepancies were solved by repeated review and discussion. Reference lists were scrutinised to detect studies overlooked by the search.Data were extracted according to an a priori protocol registering the mean age of the cohort, frequency of men, CHD status at baseline, study design, median follow-up period and main results from multivariate analysis.The study quality was assessed by evaluating design characteristics using the Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS) for cohort studies. 10  The checklist includes core domains to assess: (a) methods for selecting study participant; (b) appropriate control for confounding (comparability); and (c) methods assessing outcome variables.The diagnosis of AF should have been based upon electrocardiographic criteria and supported by hospital discharge letters and other available medical records. Objective criteria for CHD were: a confirmed hospitalisation for MI, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or CABG, a clinical diagnosis of angina pectoris verified by a positive stress test, or significant coronary artery stenosis on a coronary angiogram.Outcomes should have been verified from hospital records. Endpoint MI was defined as pure MI according to current standards, although the composite endpoints CEs (MI, angina pectoris, PCI or CABG), major CEs (coronary death and non-fatal MI) and cardiovascular events (composite of CEs (MI, acute and subacute ischaemic heart disease, CABG or PCI), cerebrovascular events (occlusion/stenosis of the precerebral/cerebral arteries or subarachnoid haemorrhage) and peripheral events (vascular interventions)) were accepted for the studies by Ruigomez et\\xa0al., 11  Marte et\\xa0al. 12  and Vermond et\\xa0al., 13  respectively.To calculate an overall relative risk (RR) we used the effect estimates and its 95% confidence interval (CI) given from multivariable analysis, and a standard random effects meta-analysis. 14The magnitude of between-study heterogeneity was evaluated by the I 2  statistics. I 2  values of 25%, 50% and 75% indicate low, moderate and high heterogeneity. 15  To investigate possible sources of heterogeneity, we performed analyses stratified by the patient characteristic CHD at baseline, and the study characteristic prospective versus retrospective timing of the study. Univariable random effects meta-regression analyses were used to examine whether effect estimates were affected by these covariates as well as by the patient covariates mean age of the cohort and frequency of men. The proportion of heterogeneity explained by the covariates was calculated by comparing the estimated between-study variance,  τ 2 , with its value when no covariates were fitted. For power consideration we needed a minimum of 10 studies per covariate in a single model of meta-regression. 16  Sensitivity analyses were conducted by omitting one study in turn from the meta-analysis and assessing its effect on the overall results. 17  Publication bias was assessed using Egger’s test, which can be used only when at least 10 studies are included in the meta-analysis. 18The analyses were performed using STATA 13.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).Our search identified 7927 references. Excluding duplicate publications and irrelevant content, 15 publications (18 studies) met our inclusion criteria. 5 , 11 – 13 , 19 – 29  The flow of information is presented in Supplementary Appendix 2. Goto et\\xa0al. 26  reported results from a CHD population (Goto_RCHD) and a risk factor-only population (Goto_RRFO). Otterstad et\\xa0al. 27  reported results for patients with prevalent AF (Otterstad_APAF) and incident AF (Otterstad_AIAF). Andersson et\\xa0al. 29  presented results separately for men and women.The studies comprised a total of 220,928 participants, of whom 17.5% were exposed to AF ( Table 1 ). The median age was 63 years (range 47–72), 59% were men (range 0–100), median follow-up was 4.9 years (range 1–21.6). CHD at baseline was present in eight studies (criteria for ruling CHD out are presented in Supplementary Appendix 3).\\n Table 1.

Confounding by age, gender, baseline cardiovascular disease and cardiac risk factors was adjusted for in multivariate analysis (Supplementary Appendix 4). In general, the studies were judged as being of a good quality (Supplementary Appendix 5).Table 2  presents inclusion criteria, study design, risk estimates and treatment with oral anticoagulants (OACs), which was reported in five studies of CHD patients, ranging from 25% to 57%, and in two for studies of patients without CHD range 1.3% to 19.9%. Comorbidity details are presented in Supplementary Appendix 6. In general, AF patients were older, had more cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities, higher body mass index and worse kidney function than non-AF patients.\\n Table 2.

CHD at baseline and the frequency of men were associated with a reduced risk of MI and explained 57% and 26% of heterogeneity, respectively ( Tables 3  and  4 ). Furthermore, the timing of the study was borderline significant and explained 11% of heterogeneity. The effect of these three covariates was not investigated simultaneously in meta-regression both due to the correlation between CHD and gender ( R \\u2009=\\u20090.5325) and few studies. In sensitivity analyses the results appeared to be robust to the influence of individual studies (Supplementary Appendix 7(a)).

Only the study characteristic timing was borderline significant associated with the outcome and explained 25% of heterogeneity ( Table 4 ). In sensitivity analyses the results appeared to be robust (Supplementary Appendix 7(b)). Publication bias was not indicated (Eggers test,  P \\u2009=\\u20090.619).The pooled estimate of nine studies ( Figure 1(c) ) showed an increased risk of HF in subjects with AF as compared to no AF (RR 4.62, 95% CI 3.13–6.83, I 2\\u2009 =\\u200996.1%). The presence of CHD at baseline, the frequency of men and timing of the study explained 30%, 27% and 36% of heterogeneity, respectively ( Table 4 ). The borderline significance might be due to power deficiency because of the scarce number of studies. In sensitivity analyses the results appeared robust (Supplementary Appendix 7(c)). Publication bias was not examined given the number of studies.Prevalent and incident AF appear to be significantly associated with MI, HF and all-cause mortality. Meta-regression analyses indicated that heterogeneity could be explained by patient and study characteristics related to the presence or absence of CHD, gender and study design being retrospective or prospective.For the endpoint MI, heterogeneity was first of all explained by pre-existing CHD; AF patients without pre-existent CHD demonstrated a significantly higher risk of MI when compared to non-AF patients as opposed to stable CHD patients.We judged all included studies to be of satisfactory methodological quality. A retrospective design was a major limitation and differences in data quality might explain the tendency towards a higher risk of all endpoints related to a prospective design, as seen in  Table 3 . This review is based on a comprehensive literature search designed to avoid a large heterogeneity related to comorbidities and acute stage scenarios of CHD manifestations and interventions, and the meta-analysis is based on comprehensively study-level adjusted estimates. However, the probability of unmeasured confounding cannot be excluded in observational studies.In a very recent meta-analysis of cohort studies, Odutayo et\\xa0al. 30  reported an increased risk for a range of different outcomes when exposed to AF, with a high level of heterogeneity. In contrast to our study, not only stable individuals with or without CHD were included, but also a variety of study populations, such as post-acute MI and post-cardiac surgery. The present meta-analysis differs substantially, as we have narrowed the spectra of patient inclusions and performed a literature search which includes text words and subject headings. Odutayo et\\xa0al. did not provide detailed information on OACs given to patients with versus without CHD, but sensitivity analysis revealed lower all-cause mortality in studies with a higher proportion of participants receiving OACs.In a recent meta-analysis of 12 studies, Guo et\\xa0al. 31  reported the same increased risk of MI in AF patients as in the present study. The risk of HF and death was not studied. Interestingly, and in line with the present study, AF was associated with a significantly increased risk of MI in patients free from CHD at baseline. Stroke prevention is a major public health priority 32  and it is of interest that a greater proportion of CHD patients were treated with an OAC than CHD-free patients, which might be explanatory for their reduced risk of MI as seen in both the study of Guo et\\xa0al. and in the present analysis.Supporting the trend towards a higher female risk of MI among AF patients in our study. Emdin et\\xa0al. 33  reported an association with a higher risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events in women.This systematic review/meta-analysis demonstrates a relationship between AF and an increased risk of CEs and mortality, but causal evidence cannot be established. In a recent study, the presence of AF has been shown to be independently associated with a heightened risk of MI despite a lower baseline burden and progression rate of coronary atheroma. 34  Similar cardiovascular risk factors of AF and MI may reflect a common pathway of underlying disease and act as confounders such that AF may not be regarded as a causal risk factor for MI, HF and death, but a surrogate of more severe disease. In view of this, Wijesurendra et\\xa0al. 35  performed magnetic resonance imaging before and after catheter ablation for AF, and stated that AF may be the consequence (rather than the cause) of an occult cardiomyopathy which persists despite a significant reduction in AF burden after ablation.AF seems to be associated with an increased risk of subsequent MI in patients without CHD and with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and HF whatever the coronary status. However, AF should not be regarded as a causal risk factor for these conditions.The authors would like to thank Matthew McGee, Morbid Obesity Center, Vestfold Hospital Trust, for proofreading the manuscript.

Coronary heart disease at baseline was associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction and explained 57% of the heterogeneity.

      "      <p>In a recent meta-analysis of patients with AF, cardiac deaths accounted for 46% of all deaths during follow-up, whereas non-haemorrhagic stroke/systemic embolism and haemorrhage-related deaths represented only 5.7% and 5.6% of the total mortality, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bibr4-2047487317715769\">4</xref></sup> As part of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study,<sup><xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bibr5-2047487317715769\">5</xref></sup> including participants free of CHD at baseline, AF was associated with a 63% increased risk of incident myocardial infarction (MI). These studies limited inclusion to either AF-only or CHD-free patients.</p>\n",
      "      <p>The objective of the present systematic review was therefore to summarise the evidence from contemporary epidemiological studies, which included patients with predominantly sinus rhythm with or without CHD at baseline, examining the association between AF and the risk of major cardiac events (CEs) and mortality, followed by an evaluation of the influence of core patient-level characteristics such as age, gender and CHD at baseline.</p>\n",

This review is based on a comprehensive literature search designed to avoid a large heterogeneity related to comorbidities and acute stage scenarios of CHD manifestations and interventions, and the meta-analysis is based on comprehensively study-level adjusted estimates.

In contrast to our study, not only stable individuals with or without CHD were included, but also a variety of study populations, such as post-acute MI and post-cardiac surgery. The present meta-analysis differs substantially, as we have narrowed the spectra of patient inclusions and performed a literature search which includes text words and subject headings. Odutayo et al. did not provide detailed information on OACs given to patients with versus without CHD, but sensitivity analysis revealed lower all-cause mortality in studies with a higher proportion of participants receiving OACs.</p>\n",
