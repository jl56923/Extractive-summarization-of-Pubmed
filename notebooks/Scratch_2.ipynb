      "      <p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of arrhythmia reported in clinical practice. As this condition is associated with an increased risk of major complications, such as thrombosis and stroke, finding optimal therapies for AF has long been a topic of interest among clinicians. Although the Cox Maze III procedure has been considered the gold standard for the surgical treatment of AF since 1991, [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref001\">1</xref>] it has not been used extensively due to its complexity and invasive character. Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), the standard catheter ablation procedure for paroxysmal AF (PrAF), has success rates exceeding 70% and acceptable complication rates [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref002\">2</xref>]. However, neither epicardial ablation nor endocardial ablation alone can achieve a satisfactory result in patients with long-standing persistent AF (LSPsAF), making these patients prone to multiple repeat procedures and complications related to excessive atrial ablation. In recent years, surgeons have combined minimally invasive thoracoscopic surgery and percutaneous catheter ablation, creating a new procedure known as hybrid ablation, in an attempt to improve success rates and curb complication rates. A few systematic reviews have summarized the existing literature, focusing on aspects such as strategies for patient selection, periprocedural anticoagulation regimens, and ablation techniques [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref003\">3</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref004\">4</xref>]. However, the efficacy and safety of the hybrid ablation procedure have not been sufficiently studied. Factors that can influence the success rates and the incidence of perioperative complications are yet to be determined. To this end, we performed a pooled analysis and meta-analysis of data from existing studies and trials.</p>\n",

Average history of atrial fibrillation was (5.0±1.6) years. The pooled proportion of patients who were arrhythmia-free at the primary endpoint was 73% (95% CI, 64%–81%, Cochran’s Q, P&lt;0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 81%). The pooled rate of severe short-term complications was 4% (95% CI, 2%–7%, Cochran’s Q, P = 0.01; I<sup>2</sup> = 51%). The success rate after one-step procedures (69%) was lower than that after staged procedures (78%). The staged approach could ultimately prove to be safer, although complication rates were relatively low for both approaches (2% and 5%, respectively).</p>\n",

      "      <p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of arrhythmia reported in clinical practice. As this condition is associated with an increased risk of major complications, such as thrombosis and stroke, finding optimal therapies for AF has long been a topic of interest among clinicians. Although the Cox Maze III procedure has been considered the gold standard for the surgical treatment of AF since 1991, [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref001\">1</xref>] it has not been used extensively due to its complexity and invasive character. Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), the standard catheter ablation procedure for paroxysmal AF (PrAF), has success rates exceeding 70% and acceptable complication rates [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref002\">2</xref>]. However, neither epicardial ablation nor endocardial ablation alone can achieve a satisfactory result in patients with long-standing persistent AF (LSPsAF), making these patients prone to multiple repeat procedures and complications related to excessive atrial ablation. In recent years, surgeons have combined minimally invasive thoracoscopic surgery and percutaneous catheter ablation, creating a new procedure known as hybrid ablation, in an attempt to improve success rates and curb complication rates. A few systematic reviews have summarized the existing literature, focusing on aspects such as strategies for patient selection, periprocedural anticoagulation regimens, and ablation techniques [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref003\">3</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref004\">4</xref>]. However, the efficacy and safety of the hybrid ablation procedure have not been sufficiently studied. Factors that can influence the success rates and the incidence of perioperative complications are yet to be determined. To this end, we performed a pooled analysis and meta-analysis of data from existing studies and trials.</p>\n",

We ran searches using EMBASE (1947–Oct. 2017) (<xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"pone.0190170.s003\">S2 File</xref>), MEDLINE (1950–Oct. 2017) (<xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"pone.0190170.s004\">S3 File</xref>), and the Cochrane library. Two authors (first and second author) independently reviewed all articles. The primary endpoint was defined as no episode of AF or atrial tachycardia longer than 30 seconds without administration of antiarrhythmic drugs. We selected only prospective studies in which all subjects in the treatment group underwent both epicardial and endocardial ablation, either simultaneously or separately. Additionally, the follow-up methods and results, including the number of patients who were arrhythmia-free at the end of the follow-up period, had to be clearly described. Studies were excluded if they did not distinctly report the follow-up outcomes or if they reported that epicardial ablation was performed by sternotomy. When several studies covered overlapping data, we chose the study including the greatest number of patients. The corresponding author made the final decision when the fist and the second author disagreed regarding the inclusion of an article or extracted data. The data were registered into a Microsoft Excel Office 2011 spread sheet.</p>\n",

Questions concerning control groups were excluded from the scale. Cohort studies were assessed using the original NOS scale. The first three questions assessed selection of the study population and representativeness of the study groups (age of patients, types and duration of AF). The following two questions evaluated how the studies determined exposure and assessed evidence that no similar procedures were previously performed. The remaining three points were awarded for outcome quality (Holter monitoring lasting at least 7 days as proof of sinus rhythm; SR), duration of follow-up (at least 12 months), and bias due to dropout or incomplete follow-up. A score of 5 or lower indicated a low-quality cohort study, while a score of 3 or lower was a marker of poor quality for single-arm trials.</p>\n",

Although several traditional reviews and a few systematic reviews have discussed hybrid ablation, to date, this is the first meta-analysis focusing on the safety and efficacy of this novel procedure. We conducted a review of the relevant literature, which consisted mostly of observational studies, as anticipated. We analyzed the success rates and complication rates in the 16 studies we ultimately selected for inclusion. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were also conducted.</p>\n",

      "          <p>In the 16 included studies, 82.7% (551/666) of patients were in sinus rhythm at the end of the follow-up period. The pooled proportion of patients in SR without administration of AADs was 73%. This was higher than the success rate (66%) previously reported in a systematic review that simply obtained an average of the SR rates in multiple studies. The pooled success rate with AADs or repeat catheter ablation(s) was 83%, which was also higher than the 78% rate reported in the aforementioned systematic review [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref004\">4</xref>]. This difference could be attributed to the superiority of meta-analyses in summarizing scientific results. Certain differences in article selection could also explain the discrepancy between the success rates. Trials conducted in different periods of time by the same researcher were included in our study, but excluded from the review article by Vroomen et al [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref004\">4</xref>]. Meanwhile, we excluded some articles with a high risk of overlap between study populations.</p>\n",
      "          <p>Few studies have directly compared the success rates of hybrid ablation to those of other therapies. Mahapatra et al [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref010\">10</xref>] matched 15 consecutive patients who underwent hybrid ablation to 30 patients who underwent a repeat CA. After a follow-up of (20.7 ± 4.5) months, 13/15 (86.7%) patients were free from AF and off AADs after hybrid ablation, while the proportion of patients without arrhythmia and off AADs after repeat CA was only 16/30 (53.3%). This study demonstrated higher success rates after hybrid ablation compared with a repeat CA, suggesting that hybrid ablation could represent a last-resort therapy for patients with LSPsAF or other indicators of an unfavorable prognosis, such as previously failed CA.</p>\n",
      "          <p>Lesion transmurality is crucial for achieving complete and durable PVI. A variety of energy sources, including RF, microwave, laser, high frequency ultrasound, and cryothermy, have been used for the ablation of AF [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref018\">18</xref>]. Experimental animal models [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref002\">2</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref018\">18</xref>] have shown that surgical ablation using bipolar RF clamps is the most reliable method of creating circumferential transmural lesions in the pulmonary veins. Clinical trials have confirmed this result. In a review article, the success rate ranged from 85.7% to 92% in studies employing bipolar RF energy and from 36.8% to 88.9% in those utilizing unipolar RF energy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref019\">19</xref>]. Our meta-analysis reached similar conclusions. The pooled proportion of patients in SR was 84% after bipolar ablation and 67% after unipolar RF ablation.</p>\n",
      "          <p>Patients who had undergone previous CA had a lower treatment success rate (74%) than those who had not (87%). This discrepancy could be explained by the fact that previously failed ablation is suggestive of challenging cases with a stronger tendency for PV reconnection after ablation and an atrial substrate that promotes AF maintenance. The mechanisms of AF recurrence might be different in these patients [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref020\">20</xref>].</p>\n",

      "          <p>Patient safety has always been a top priority for cardiac surgeons and electrophysiologists. The hybrid ablation procedure was designed to decrease the high rate of complications associated with the traditional cut-and-sew method, while ensuring a relatively high success rate. The overall rate of short-term severe complications in our meta-analysis was 4%. This was lower than the rate previously reported by Boersma et al [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref021\">21</xref>] (9.8%) and Pokushalov et al [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref022\">22</xref>] (25%) in epicardial only (mini-maze) ablation procedures, but comparable to the 3.6% rate reported by Wang et al [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref023\">23</xref>]. As complications associated with hybrid ablation are reportedly mostly surgery-related, it is safe to conclude that the rate of severe complications associated with this procedure is no higher than the complication rate of stand-alone thoracoscopic surgical ablation. Although several authors reported no complications associated with the hybrid procedure in small to medium-sized population samples [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref010\">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref024\">24</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref026\">26</xref>], avoiding certain life-threatening complications remains a challenge for clinicians.</p>\n",
      "          <p>Atrial-esophageal fistula is a rare but life-threatening condition, which can be difficult to diagnose and can lead to death despite active treatment. Both Kiser et al [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref027\">27</xref>] (two cases) and Gehi et al [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref009\">9</xref>] (one case) reported the occurrence of atrial-esophageal fistulas and death after the use of the transdiaphragmatic surgical approach. Unipolar RF was the energy source for epicardial ablation in both of these studies. This complication could be attributed to the fact that bipolar RF clamps direct the ablation energy exclusively toward the pulmonary veins, while unipolar devices inevitably expose the esophagus to heat radiation during the ablation.</p>\n",
      "          <p>Currently, RF ablation can be performed by either a thoracoscopic or a transdiaphragmatic approach. Given the nature of epicardial ablation, the possibility of perioperative cardiac tamponade is low, since the pericardium is open during the surgical procedure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref011\">11</xref>]. Only one case of cardiac tamponade was reported (on day 24 after surgery) across the 11 studies that adopted the thoracoscopic approach in epicardial ablation. The five studies (n = 356) that adopted the transdiaphragmatic approach reported five cases of cardiac tamponade. The incidence of this complication across the five studies was 1.4% (5/356), suggesting that the transdiaphragmatic approach could carry a higher risk of cardiac tamponade. Further investigation is needed to identify the underlying causes.</p>\n",
      "          <p>Excision or ligation of the LAA during the procedure did not seem to influence the perioperative complication rate (4% with ligation vs. 5% with untouched LAA), although these steps can theoretically increase the odds of short-term hemorrhagic complications. Routine excision of the LAA during hybrid ablation procedures appears to be relatively safe.</p>\n",
      "          <p>As surgical centers continue to adopt hybrid ablation as a treatment option for persistent AF, safety remains the primary focus of clinicians. It is unreasonable to expose patients to a high risk of surgical complications, especially since hybrid ablation was designed to avoid the risks associated with open heart surgery. Further research is necessary to identify the best means of avoiding severe complications.</p>\n",

      "        <p>By definition, the hybrid procedure combines thoracoscopic epicardial ablation with a catheter ablation procedure. However, whether a two-step procedure is superior to a one-step approach is yet to be determined. The subgroup analysis showed that the pooled success rate at the primary endpoint was lower after one-step procedures (69%) than after staged procedures (78%). The blanking period following PVI, during which the epicardial lesions mature and stabilize, may have contributed to this difference in outcomes. Reimbursement issues also played a role in the choice of procedure, as in some cases surgical decisions were shaped by reimbursement policies rather than medical considerations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref008\">8</xref>]. Safety outcomes favor the staged approach (2%), although the complication rates are relatively low with both approaches (2% vs. 5%). Administration of anticoagulants (heparin) during CA can theoretically lead to higher incidence of hemorrhagic complications. Prolonged procedural time is a risk factor for complications as well. Although it can be partly attributed to the learning curve of surgical teams, the 2%-5% complication rate is still far from satisfactory. Further refinement of surgical techniques is necessary. The current data suggest that staged hybrid ablation could be the optimal approach, due to its higher success rate and a seemingly lower complication rate.</p>\n",

De Asmundis et al [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0190170.ref028\">28</xref>] reported that conversion to SR during ablation did not improve clinical outcomes after an average follow-up time of 19 months (<italic>P</italic> = 0.47).

      "          <p>Atrial fibrillation is a large and growing burden across all types of healthcare. Both incidence and prevalence are expected to double in the next 20 years, with huge impact on hospital admissions, costs and patient quality of life. Patient wellbeing determines the management strategy for atrial fibrillation, including the use of rhythm control therapy and the clinical success of heart rate control. Hence, evaluation of quality of life is an emerging and important part of the assessment of patients with atrial fibrillation. Although a number of questionnaires to assess quality of life in atrial fibrillation are available, a comprehensive overview of their measurement properties is lacking.</p>\n",

      "          <p>We performed a systematic review of the measurement properties of atrial fibrillation-specific health-related quality of life questionnaires. Methodological quality was assessed using the Consensus based Standards for selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist, with measurement properties rated for quality against optimal criteria and levels of evidence. We screened 2,216 articles, of which eight articles describing five questionnaires were eligible for inclusion: Atrial Fibrillation 6 (AF6), Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-Life (AFEQT), Atrial Fibrillation Quality of Life Questionnaire (AFQLQ), Atrial Fibrillation Quality of Life (AFQoL), and Quality of Life in Atrial Fibrillation (QLAF). Good reliability (internal consistency and test-retest reliability) was demonstrated for AF6, AFEQT, AFQLQ and AFQoL. Content, construct and criterion validity were positively rated only in AFEQT. Responsiveness was positively rated only in AFEQT, but with limited evidence. Overall, AFEQT showed strong positive evidence for 2 of 9 measurement properties, compared to one for AFQoL and none for the remaining questionnaires.</p>\n",

Further studies to robustly assess reliability, validity and responsiveness of AF-specific quality of life questionnaires are required. This review consolidates the current evidence for quality of life assessment in patients with atrial fibrillation and identifies priority areas for future research.</p>\n",

      "      <p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is predicted to double in prevalence over the next 20 years. It is not only associated with adverse prognosis, but accounts for considerable healthcare expenditure. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref001\">1</xref>] Numerous studies have identified a substantial reduction in health-related quality of life (QoL) in AF populations. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref002\">2</xref>] Patients with AF experience symptoms such as palpitations, exercise intolerance, dizziness and dyspnea, which frequently limit capacity to undertake daily activities. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref003\">3</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref004\">4</xref>]</p>\n",
      "      <p>Apart from anticoagulation to prevent strokes, current management of AF is focused on reducing symptoms and improving QoL. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref005\">5</xref>] Even well-established therapies in AF have proven to have little impact on death and other adverse outcomes, including rate and rhythm control therapy. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref006\">6</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref009\">9</xref>] Although the fundamental reason for pursing such therapies is to improve QoL, there is limited appreciation of how to measure QoL in clinical practice.</p>\n",
      "      <p>A variety of both generic and AF-specific questionnaires are available to assess patient-reported QoL. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref010\">10</xref>] Generic patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), such as the SF-36 and EQ-5D questionnaires, have the advantage of allowing comparison of QoL in patients with different diseases, but are less sensitive to the effects of a single disease on QoL. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref011\">11</xref>] With the growing burden of AF, the relatively high cost of treatment, and the appreciation of QoL as a treatment objective, there has been substantial interest in the development of AF-specific PROMs for use in both clinical research and routine practice. However, these have yet to enter routine clinical practice, in part due to concerns about their validity and responsiveness. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref012\">12</xref>]</p>\n",
      "      <p>Our objective was to perform a systematic review of the measurement properties of disease-specific PROMs measuring QoL in AF, assessing studies which designed and validated the questionnaires. We aim to provide clinicians with an understanding of whether these instruments would likely be of value in research and clinical practice. We utilized a comprehensive methodology from the Consensus based Standards for selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) group [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref013\">13</xref>], which includes rigorous assessment of validity, reliability, and responsiveness of QoL questionnaires.</p>\n",

The search strategy (see <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"pone.0165790.s001\">S1 Appendix</xref>) consisted of 3 filters composed of search terms for the following: (1) AF; (2) PROMs; and (3) measurement properties. The latter two filters were developed at the University of Oxford and VU University Medical Center [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref014\">14</xref>] respectively (available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" ns0:href=\"http://www.cosmin.nl\">www.cosmin.nl</ext-link>).

      "      <p>This comprehensive systematic review identified five health-related QoL questionnaires used to assess AF populations, and evaluated their measurement properties using the COSMIN approach. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate the methodological quality of studies and the measurement properties of QoL questionnaires in AF patients. Our key finding was the lack of robust psychometric testing of any of the currently available AF-specific QoL instrument, particularly for measurement error. We found deficiencies in most instruments in relation to reliability, construct and criterion validity, but particularly in the responsiveness of questionnaires. The results raise important questions about the use of these instruments in research and daily clinical practice, and suggest the need for further evaluation before implementation.</p>\n",
      "      <p>Quality of life encompasses a person's perceptions of their physical and psychological state, social relationships and environment. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref026\">26</xref>] Many generic and disease-specific questionnaires exist to assess QoL in AF patients. The Short Form 36 (SF-36) is perhaps the most common generic QoL measure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref004\">4</xref>], and often used as a gold-standard comparator in the validation of other questionnaires (although as there is no ‘true’ gold-standard measure, criterion validity remains problematic to adequately appraise). Generic measures are useful to determine overall QoL in the population, particularly to quantify health utility or for comparing between diseases and populations. However, they may not be as sensitive to the effect of a single disease on QoL [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref011\">11</xref>], whereas disease-specific questionnaires assess domains more relevant to the particular condition and may provide more targeted information to inform shared-decision making. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref010\">10</xref>] There is increasing interest in evaluating the effect of management strategies on QoL among AF patients, but for clinical confidence, the tool used should demonstrate good responsiveness, in addition to being a reliable and valid measure. Indeed, a recently developed QoL questionnaire for patients undergoing catheter ablation for cardiac arrhythmias has demonstrated responsiveness to clinical change. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref027\">27</xref>]</p>\n",
      "      <p>This review utilized the COSMIN approach for performing the systematic review. The COSMIN taxonomy was developed after an international Delphi study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref013\">13</xref>], using a consensus of terminology across validation studies and allowing standardized objective assessment of measurement properties. Further, the group have developed standards (the COSMIN checklist) for how measurement properties should be evaluated [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref028\">28</xref>] and provide a structured protocol for undertaking such reviews to a high quality (<ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" ns0:href=\"http://www.cosmin.nl/\">http://www.cosmin.nl/</ext-link>). The COSMIN methodology has been incorporated into several other reviews to evaluate PROM assessment across a variety of diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref029\">29</xref>], osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref030\">30</xref>], cancer [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref031\">31</xref>], multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref032\">32</xref>] and Parkinson’s Disease. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref032\">32</xref>] Whilst the standards within COSMIN are high, the thresholds for reliability are in line with the International Society for Quality of Life Research (ISOQOL) requirements. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref033\">33</xref>] It could be argued that high standards are needed to drive improvements in the methodology of development and validation of PROMs, and allow clinicians to have greater confidence in their use. As with any system based on scientific judgment, our results based on the COSMIN approach are only one component of evaluating quality of life questionnaires.</p>\n",
      "      <p>A specific limitation of our review was the inclusion of questionnaires developed and validated before the COSMIN checklist became widely available, which may have impacted on the scores assigned for methodological quality. This may be less of an issue in future reviews, where validation studies would ideally have incorporated the COSMIN checklist. There are other methodologies available for evaluating PROMs, for example the Federal Drug Administration scheme, which utilizes broadly similar assessment categories. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref034\">34</xref>] However, the COSMIN approach offers a more quantifiable appraisal of measurement properties. Secondly, the inclusion of two Japanese papers requiring translation meant these articles were assessed by a sole reviewer, which may impact on internal validity. We are also limited to the ‘general’ AF populations studied, whereas patients with specific comorbidities may respond differently to PROMs. For example, heart failure is a common comorbidity in AF [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref035\">35</xref>] that is underrepresented in the studies evaluated.</p>\n",
      "      <p>The content of these questionnaires demonstrates some similarities among them, with 4 out of 5 examining the type and/or frequency of symptoms (the only exception being AFQoL), and all except QLAF assessing the impact of AF on daily activities, physical and psychological functioning, albeit to differing extent. Synthesis of results in our review showed that AFEQT demonstrated strong positive evidence for internal consistency and content validity and AFQoL showed strong positive evidence for content validity. All other questionnaires failed to provide sufficient evidence to make a strong positive rating. Neither measurement error nor cross-cultural validity were appropriately assessed in any study and there were limited data for responsiveness, which we were only able to rate for AFEQT. Where study quality was poor, or ratings indeterminate, this does not mean that a particular questionnaire performed badly, only that the evidence was limited. For example, AFQoL, in addition to AFEQT, demonstrated strong positive evidence for content validity, an important measurement property that is the foundation of a good QoL questionnaire.</p>\n",
      "      <p>Refinements to AF PROMs are ongoing, and AFQLQ was recently updated to a second version, demonstrating good intra- and inter-observer reproducibility and internal consistency in 40 AF patients. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref036\">36</xref>] However, even with full information on psychometric properties, clinical validity requires further appraisal in large-scale AF populations, a review of which is beyond the scope of this methodological assessment. Apart from AFEQT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref037\">37</xref>], there is limited information about the minimally important change seen with these questionnaires.</p>\n",
      "      <p>With the growing burden of AF and the equivocal benefit of rate or rhythm-control strategies in improving mortality [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref006\">6</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref009\">9</xref>], there is increasing importance of QoL assessment. Over 34 different QoL questionnaires have been utilized in published AF studies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref010\">10</xref>] emphasizing the current lack of consensus on the best instrument to assess QoL. Our assessment of methodological quality suggests that reported results for the available instruments should be treated with caution and that further, more robust validation is required to determine if these measures are appropriate to assess QoL in clinical populations. However, adequate measurement properties are just one aspect of whether a QoL tool is useful in research and clinical practice. Cost, ease of administration, time taken and patient acceptability are also important considerations. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"pone.0165790.ref029\">29</xref>] Future studies are clearly required that address the detectable change in scores, as well as the responsiveness of the questionnaire to changes in patient symptoms and management strategies in the clinical setting. One such study that is due to commence shorty is the RAte Control Therapy Evaluation in Atrial Fibrillation (RATE-AF) randomized trial.

Analyses indicated that atrial fibrillation was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (relative risk (RR) 1.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26–1.85), all-cause mortality (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.50–2.54) and heart failure (RR 4.62, 95% CI 3.13–6.83). Coronary heart disease at baseline was associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction and explained 57% of the heterogeneity. A prospective cohort design accounted for 25% of all-cause mortality heterogeneity. Due to there being fewer than 10 studies, sources of heterogeneity were inconclusive for heart failure. Atrial fibrillation seems to be associated with an increased risk of subsequent myocardial infarction in patients without coronary heart disease and an increased risk of, all-cause mortality and heart failure in patients with and without coronary heart disease.'"

       "'Current treatment of thromboembolic complications associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) has mainly focused on the prevention of stroke. 1 , 2  Notwithstanding, patients with AF frequently develop coronary heart disease (CHD). Similar cardiovascular risk factors for CHD and AF have been suggested to reflect a common pathway of underlying vascular disease. 3 In a recent meta-analysis of patients with AF, cardiac deaths accounted for 46% of all deaths during follow-up, whereas non-haemorrhagic stroke/systemic embolism and haemorrhage-related deaths represented only 5.7% and 5.6% of the total mortality, respectively. 4  As part of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, 5  including participants free of CHD at baseline, AF was associated with a 63% increased risk of incident myocardial infarction (MI). These studies limited inclusion to either AF-only or CHD-free patients. The objective of the present systematic review was therefore to summarise the evidence from contemporary epidemiological studies, which included patients with predominantly sinus rhythm with or without CHD at baseline, examining the association between AF and the risk of major cardiac events (CEs) and mortality, followed by an evaluation of the influence of core patient-level characteristics such as age, gender and CHD at baseline. The review protocol has been registered at  http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/  (reg. CRD42016033209). The manuscript was prepared according to the 2009 PRISMA checklist. 6 We selected randomised trials or observational studies of clinically stable patients that evaluated MI, heart failure (HF) and mortality as endpoints in AF patients versus patients without AF; both categories with or without preceding CHD. To reflect contemporary management in view of the large differences in risk and outcome as compared to earlier management strategies 7  we considered articles published between 1 January 2006 and 21 October 2016. In order to minimise the problems associated with small-scale studies, at least 500 participants who were haemodynamically stable on inclusion and followed for 12 months or longer were required. As the unfavourable prognosis of AF complicating an acute MI 8  and cardiac surgery 9  is well established, studies selected had to have included patients who had sustained an MI or coronary artery bypass graft operation (CABG) more than 30 days prior to inclusion. Studies recruiting patients with acute AF at baseline were excluded, as were outcome studies comparing the prognostic impact of rate versus rhythm control in AF patients. We searched the databases Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library and Pubmed (including articles published ahead of print). Our search strategy combined text words and subject headings, with details presented in Supplementary Appendix 1. Two investigators independently evaluated studies for eligibility. Discrepancies were solved by repeated review and discussion. Reference lists were scrutinised to detect studies overlooked by the search. Data were extracted according to an a priori protocol registering the mean age of the cohort, frequency of men, CHD status at baseline, study design, median follow-up period and main results from multivariate analysis. The study quality was assessed by evaluating design characteristics using the Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS) for cohort studies. 10  The checklist includes core domains to assess: (a) methods for selecting study participant; (b) appropriate control for confounding (comparability); and (c) methods assessing outcome variables. The diagnosis of AF should have been based upon electrocardiographic criteria and supported by hospital discharge letters and other available medical records. Objective criteria for CHD were: a confirmed hospitalisation for MI, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or CABG, a clinical diagnosis of angina pectoris verified by a positive stress test, or significant coronary artery stenosis on a coronary angiogram. Outcomes should have been verified from hospital records. Endpoint MI was defined as pure MI according to current standards, although the composite endpoints CEs (MI, angina pectoris, PCI or CABG), major CEs (coronary death and non-fatal MI) and cardiovascular events (composite of CEs (MI, acute and subacute ischaemic heart disease, CABG or PCI), cerebrovascular events (occlusion/stenosis of the precerebral/cerebral arteries or subarachnoid haemorrhage) and peripheral events (vascular interventions)) were accepted for the studies by Ruigomez et\\xa0al., 11  Marte et\\xa0al. 12  and Vermond et\\xa0al., 13  respectively. To calculate an overall relative risk (RR) we used the effect estimates and its 95% confidence interval (CI) given from multivariable analysis, and a standard random effects meta-analysis. 14 The magnitude of between-study heterogeneity was evaluated by the I 2  statistics. I 2  values of 25%, 50% and 75% indicate low, moderate and high heterogeneity. 15  To investigate possible sources of heterogeneity, we performed analyses stratified by the patient characteristic CHD at baseline, and the study characteristic prospective versus retrospective timing of the study. Univariable random effects meta-regression analyses were used to examine whether effect estimates were affected by these covariates as well as by the patient covariates mean age of the cohort and frequency of men. The proportion of heterogeneity explained by the covariates was calculated by comparing the estimated between-study variance,  τ 2 , with its value when no covariates were fitted. For power consideration we needed a minimum of 10 studies per covariate in a single model of meta-regression. 16  Sensitivity analyses were conducted by omitting one study in turn from the meta-analysis and assessing its effect on the overall results. 17  Publication bias was assessed using Egger’s test, which can be used only when at least 10 studies are included in the meta-analysis. 18 The analyses were performed using STATA 13.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). Our search identified 7927 references. Excluding duplicate publications and irrelevant content, 15 publications (18 studies) met our inclusion criteria. 5 , 11 – 13 , 19 – 29  The flow of information is presented in Supplementary Appendix 2. Goto et\\xa0al. 26  reported results from a CHD population (Goto_RCHD) and a risk factor-only population (Goto_RRFO). Otterstad et\\xa0al. 27  reported results for patients with prevalent AF (Otterstad_APAF) and incident AF (Otterstad_AIAF). Andersson et\\xa0al. 29  presented results separately for men and women. The studies comprised a total of 220,928 participants, of whom 17.5% were exposed to AF ( Table 1 ). The median age was 63 years (range 47–72), 59% were men (range 0–100), median follow-up was 4.9 years (range 1–21.6). CHD at baseline was present in eight studies (criteria for ruling CHD out are presented in Supplementary Appendix 3).\\n Table 1.

All studies were cohort designs, eight with prospective timing. Confounding by age, gender, baseline cardiovascular disease and cardiac risk factors was adjusted for in multivariate analysis (Supplementary Appendix 4). In general, the studies were judged as being of a good quality (Supplementary Appendix 5). Table 2  presents inclusion criteria, study design, risk estimates and treatment with oral anticoagulants (OACs), which was reported in five studies of CHD patients, ranging from 25% to 57%, and in two for studies of patients without CHD range 1.3% to 19.9%. Comorbidity details are presented in Supplementary Appendix 6. In general, AF patients were older, had more cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities, higher body mass index and worse kidney function than non-AF patients.\\n Table 2.

CHD at baseline and the frequency of men were associated with a reduced risk of MI and explained 57% and 26% of heterogeneity, respectively ( Tables 3  and  4 ). Furthermore, the timing of the study was borderline significant and explained 11% of heterogeneity. The effect of these three covariates was not investigated simultaneously in meta-regression both due to the correlation between CHD and gender ( R \\u2009=\\u20090.5325) and few studies.

In sensitivity analyses the results appeared to be robust (Supplementary Appendix 7(b)). Publication bias was not indicated (Eggers test,  P \\u2009=\\u20090.619). The pooled estimate of nine studies ( Figure 1(c) ) showed an increased risk of HF in subjects with AF as compared to no AF (RR 4.62, 95% CI 3.13–6.83, I 2\\u2009 =\\u200996.1%). The presence of CHD at baseline, the frequency of men and timing of the study explained 30%, 27% and 36% of heterogeneity, respectively ( Table 4 ). The borderline significance might be due to power deficiency because of the scarce number of studies. In sensitivity analyses the results appeared robust (Supplementary Appendix 7(c)). Publication bias was not examined given the number of studies. Prevalent and incident AF appear to be significantly associated with MI, HF and all-cause mortality. Meta-regression analyses indicated that heterogeneity could be explained by patient and study characteristics related to the presence or absence of CHD, gender and study design being retrospective or prospective. For the endpoint MI, heterogeneity was first of all explained by pre-existing CHD; AF patients without pre-existent CHD demonstrated a significantly higher risk of MI when compared to non-AF patients as opposed to stable CHD patients. We judged all included studies to be of satisfactory methodological quality. A retrospective design was a major limitation and differences in data quality might explain the tendency towards a higher risk of all endpoints related to a prospective design, as seen in  Table 3 . This review is based on a comprehensive literature search designed to avoid a large heterogeneity related to comorbidities and acute stage scenarios of CHD manifestations and interventions, and the meta-analysis is based on comprehensively study-level adjusted estimates. However, the probability of unmeasured confounding cannot be excluded in observational studies. In a very recent meta-analysis of cohort studies, Odutayo et\\xa0al. 30  reported an increased risk for a range of different outcomes when exposed to AF, with a high level of heterogeneity. In contrast to our study, not only stable individuals with or without CHD were included, but also a variety of study populations, such as post-acute MI and post-cardiac surgery. The present meta-analysis differs substantially, as we have narrowed the spectra of patient inclusions and performed a literature search which includes text words and subject headings. Odutayo et\\xa0al. did not provide detailed information on OACs given to patients with versus without CHD, but sensitivity analysis revealed lower all-cause mortality in studies with a higher proportion of participants receiving OACs. In a recent meta-analysis of 12 studies, Guo et\\xa0al. 31  reported the same increased risk of MI in AF patients as in the present study. The risk of HF and death was not studied. Interestingly, and in line with the present study, AF was associated with a significantly increased risk of MI in patients free from CHD at baseline. Stroke prevention is a major public health priority 32  and it is of interest that a greater proportion of CHD patients were treated with an OAC than CHD-free patients, which might be explanatory for their reduced risk of MI as seen in both the study of Guo et\\xa0al. and in the present analysis. Supporting the trend towards a higher female risk of MI among AF patients in our study. Emdin et\\xa0al. 33  reported an association with a higher risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events in women. This systematic review/meta-analysis demonstrates a relationship between AF and an increased risk of CEs and mortality, but causal evidence cannot be established. In a recent study, the presence of AF has been shown to be independently associated with a heightened risk of MI despite a lower baseline burden and progression rate of coronary atheroma. 34  Similar cardiovascular risk factors of AF and MI may reflect a common pathway of underlying disease and act as confounders such that AF may not be regarded as a causal risk factor for MI, HF and death, but a surrogate of more severe disease. In view of this, Wijesurendra et\\xa0al. 35  performed magnetic resonance imaging before and after catheter ablation for AF, and stated that AF may be the consequence (rather than the cause) of an occult cardiomyopathy which persists despite a significant reduction in AF burden after ablation. AF seems to be associated with an increased risk of subsequent MI in patients without CHD and with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and HF whatever the coronary status. However, AF should not be regarded as a causal risk factor for these conditions.'"

       "'Hyperthyroidism, or thyrotoxicosis occurs due to excess release of thyroid hormone due to an overactive thyroid gland or passive release of the stored hormone. Additionally, hyperthyroidism occurs from over treatment with thyroid hormone. Hyperthyroidism is generally considered overt or subclinical, depending on the biochemical severity of the hyperthyroidism. Overt hyperthyroidism is defined as suppressed (usually undetectable) thyrotropin (TSH) and elevated levels of triiodothyronine (T3) and/or estimated free thyroxine (free T4). Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a low or undetectable serum TSH with values within the normal reference range for both T3 and free T4. 1  Hyperthyroidism should be considered the potential illness whenever TSH level is subnormal. The prevalence of hyperthyroidism in the United States is approximately 1.2% (0.5% overt and 0.7% subclinical). 2  In an older community in Baltimore, the prevalence of low TSH was 9.6% for participants on thyroid hormone and 0.8% for untreated individuals. 3  In a study performed by Krahn et al., the authors found that <1% of cases of atrial fibrillation are secondary to an acute hyperthyroid state. 4  Despite hyperthyroidism being a relatively rare cause of atrial fibrillation, this review underscores the importance of identifying thyrotoxic atrial fibrillation, understanding differences in pathophysiology and management as well as illustrating the importance of screening for hyperthyroidism in those presenting with atrial fibrillation. We have compiled literature from PubMed, Scopus and Ovid to ensure a thorough and accurate literature review. Hyperthyroidism is a well-known cause of atrial fibrillation. In a large population based study by frost and colleagues, all patients with new onset hyperthyroidism in the inpatient setting were followed ±30\\xa0days from the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism to observe for a new onset diagnosis of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. It was found that 8.3% of such patients had a new onset diagnosis of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. 2  In patients with hyperthyroidism it was found that those who were male, advancing age, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and valvular heart disease were found to have a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation. 5 In a large nationwide cohort study performed in Denmark by Selmer and colleagues, patients who were diagnosed with new onset atrial fibrillation were followed in the outpatient setting for 13 years to identify if they would develop hyperthyroidism. 6  In the 13\\xa0year follow up there was a significantly higher incidence of hyperthyroidism being diagnosed particularly in the male population between the ages of 51–60 when compared to the general population of that age without a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. Another Canadian study was performed testing this association on a smaller scale and failed to show an association. 7  However, as the study performed by Selmer and colleagues was the most comprehensive study, its clinical application includes routine screening for hyperthyroidism in patients with new onset atrial fibrillation. While there are no studies on the incidence of subclinical hyperthyroidism after presenting with atrial fibrillation, routine monitoring of thyroid studies would identify this subgroup. The authors believed that these findings may have been secondary to: 1 Autoantibody formation against β1-adrenergic and M2-muscarinic receptors has been known to occur in hyperthyroidism and may trigger Atrial fibrillation prior to thyroid dysfunction. 8 2 A genetic susceptibility to atrial fibrillation may be linked to hyperthyroidism 9 3 Patients may have relative rises or falls in thyroid function testing, yet still remain within normal limits compared to reference values. Such variation may increase the risk of developing atrial fibrillation and will subsequently increase the risk of clinical hyperthyroidism in the future 10 ,  11 Autoantibody formation against β1-adrenergic and M2-muscarinic receptors has been known to occur in hyperthyroidism and may trigger Atrial fibrillation prior to thyroid dysfunction. 8 A genetic susceptibility to atrial fibrillation may be linked to hyperthyroidism 9 Patients may have relative rises or falls in thyroid function testing, yet still remain within normal limits compared to reference values. Such variation may increase the risk of developing atrial fibrillation and will subsequently increase the risk of clinical hyperthyroidism in the future 10 ,  11 Current guidelines are not available regarding frequency of screening and are per clinician discretion. Atrial fibrillation irrespective of thyroid function is believed to be due to chaotic electrical activity resulting in a micro-reentrant tachycardia. 12  The wavelength theory described by Allessie and co-workers describes a wavelength, which is a product of atrial refractoriness and conduction velocity. If the patient has a long wavelength as per this theory then re-entry will not be maintained and thus self terminate. 13  In order for atrial fibrillation to be sustained the wavelength has to be short enough such that wavefronts can circulate the atrium without termination. As per this theory, atrial refractoriness, conduction velocity or both has to be sufficiently reduced to allow re-entry of wavefronts and sustainment of atrial fibrillatory waves. Other theories exist regarding the mechanism of atrial fibrillation including the presence of anatomical substrate and abnormal ectopic atrial firing. Because anyone of these abnormal findings can result in atrial fibrillation, it is important to note differences in pathophysiology between those who have atrial fibrillation with hyperthyroid and euthyroid functions. In those patients who were hyperthyroid it was found that elevated thyroid hormone altered the β1-adrenergic and M2-muscarinic receptors of the heart resulting in increased sympathetic function, tachycardia and decreased atrial refractory period. It is also known that thyroid hormone plays a role in altering ionic channels. In a study performed by Watanbe et al. the effects of thyroid hormone on mRNA expression and currents of major ionic channels were studied in murine atria. The authors found that thyroid hormone resulted in such major changes 14 : 1.) Decreased L-type Calcium channel mRNA expression 2.) Increased expression of Kv 1.5 mRNA 3.) The above changes resulted in increased outward current and decreased inward current resulting in shorter action potential duration Decreased L-type Calcium channel mRNA expression Increased expression of Kv 1.5 mRNA The above changes resulted in increased outward current and decreased inward current resulting in shorter action potential duration In another study performed in rats, the authors compared action potential duration and whole cell currents in the right and left atria in both euthyroid and hyperthyroid mice. The authors found more significant shortening of APD and greater delayed rectifier potassium current increases in the right atrium than the left atrium in hyperthyroid rats which can further increase the risk for atrial arrhythmias. 15  A separate study performed by Chen et al. studied the effects of thyroid hormone on the arrhythmogenic activity of pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes in rabbits. The authors found that thyroid hormone had the following effects on arrhythmogenesis 16 : 1.) Decreased APD 2.) Increased spontaneous activity in pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes 3.) Increased occurrence of delayed after-depolarizations in pulmonary vein beating and non-beating cardiomyocytes 4.) Increased after-depolarizations in beating cardiomyocytes Decreased APD Increased spontaneous activity in pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes Increased occurrence of delayed after-depolarizations in pulmonary vein beating and non-beating cardiomyocytes Increased after-depolarizations in beating cardiomyocytes With the following changes noted, the authors concluded that thyroid hormone plays a role on arrhythmogenesis with an increase of triggered activity or automaticity in pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes. 16 Atrial fibrillation in hyperthyroid human patients, similar to the animal models as discussed is believed to be due to a decreased atrial refractory period and increased sympathetic tone with decreased heart-rate variability. 17  Wustmann and colleagues noted that hyperthyroid patients with no known diagnosis of atrial fibrillation when compared to euthyroid patients without a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation were found to have an increased incidence of supraventricular depolarizations which normalized after treating the hyperthyroidism. 18  While these supraventricular depolarizations have been linked to developing atrial fibrillation in patients who are euthyroid, Wustmann and colleagues did not attempt to prove any causal relationship in hyperthyroid patients. Another study performed by Komiya and colleagues showed that when invasive electrophysiological tests were performed on hyperthyroid patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, in comparison to the control group, there was no increased incidence of abnormal atrial electrograms, whereas those with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who were euthyroid had a significantly increased incidence of abnormal atrial electrograms when compared to the control. Komiya and colleagues also noted that in patients who were euthyroid, atrial refractory period was not reduced in comparison to controls. 19  Interestingly, the only common finding noted between euthyroid and hyperthyroid patients in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation was a prolonged conduction delay and conduction zone. A flowchart illustrating the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation in hyperthyroidism is shown in  Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 A figure illustrating the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation in hyperthyroidism. A figure illustrating the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation in hyperthyroidism. Sawin and his group reported a 2.8-fold increased risk of atrial fibrillation in subclinical hyperthyroid individuals over the age of 60. 20  Subsequent studies reported similar results. 21 ,  22  The Rotterdam study performed by Heeringa and colleagues, showed a graded response in patients with atrial fibrillation and thyroxine levels and lower TSH. 11  The mechanism involved was hypothesized by Heeringa and colleagues and is believed to be threefold: 1 Active T 3 binds to T3 Nuclear receptors resulting in specific cardiac gene expression 2 T3 Reduces heart rate variability by reducing vagal tone increasing risk for arrhythmias 3 T3 causes peripheral vasodilation increasing cardiac preload and altering contraction Active T 3 binds to T3 Nuclear receptors resulting in specific cardiac gene expression T3 Reduces heart rate variability by reducing vagal tone increasing risk for arrhythmias T3 causes peripheral vasodilation increasing cardiac preload and altering contraction TSH has also been identified as an independent predictor of developing atrial fibrillation with lower limits of normal increasing risk regardless of free T4 levels in patients greater than age 60 within the next decade. 20  While no guidelines are available regarding the frequency of monitoring thyroid function, the association noted prompts close monitoring of thyroid function status in the elderly per clinician discretion. Cardioversion may be an option in those who remain in atrial fibrillation after 8–10 weeks of remaining in a euthyroid state with anticoagulation for at least three weeks due to the concern of atrial stunning. In patients with atrial fibrillation who are of euthyroid or hyperthyroid status at the time of diagnosis, it is important to note that the chances of failed cardioversion dramatically increase with time. A large risk for recurrence is noted 1\\xa0year after diagnosis and even larger risk of recurrence 2 years after diagnosis. 23  In a study performed by Gurdogan and colleagues, irrespective of thyroid status, prolonged duration of atrial fibrillation prior to cardioversion was a poor predictor for sustaining sinus rhythm. 24  Further studies are required to identify those who are good candidates for cardioversion when there is a history of hyperthyroidism. In patients with hyperthyroidism related atrial fibrillation, there is no clear consensus in the present literature regarding the efficacy of catheter ablation. Ma et al. studied the efficacy of circumferential pulmonary vein ablation in patients with thyrotoxic atrial fibrillation and found that it was a viable therapeutic option. 25  A case-control study evaluating the efficacy of catheter ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with a history of AIT found that a single ablation with pulmonary vein isolation had a lower efficacy when compared to patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation without a history of AIT. A history of AIT was also found to be an independent predictor of atrial tachycardia. After multiple ablations however, the risk of recurrence was noted to be equal in patients with and without AIT. 26  A subsequent study performed by Wang et al. studying the safety and efficacy of early radiofrequency catheter ablation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation complicated with AIT found that pulmonary vein isolation was safe and efficacious with a higher incidence of atrial tachyarrhythmias occurring up to three months post procedure but were not noted 12 months post procedure when matched with controls. 27  In a separate study performed by Machino et al., the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation with pulmonary vein isolation was tested in patients who had a history of hyperthyroidism and were euthyroid for a period of three months and matched with a control group of patients with atrial fibrillation without a history of hyperthyroidism. The authors found that there was no difference in risk of occurrence of atrial fibrillation in both groups. 28  Another study performed by Wongcharoen et al. showed that patients with a history of hyperthyroidism had more frequent ectopic events and a higher risk of occurrence of atrial fibrillation after a single ablation. 29  In this study however, the risk of recurrence was not tested after multiple ablations. In the majority of studies, ablation was considered after restoring a euthyroid state for at least three months and was indicated for refractory atrial fibrillation. Thus we conclude that in those patients who have permenant, refractory atrial fibrillation despite restoration of a euthyroid state, ablation may be considered. However, owing to the higher risk of recurrence, multiple ablations are usually required. Atrial Fibrillation has been known to significantly increase the risk of developing stroke and thrombotic episodes. The current guidelines use the CHA2DS2-VASC scoring system to predict who is at increased risk for a thrombotic episode and would benefit from anticoagulation. Atrial Fibrillation with hyperthyroidism has been studied in various trials with varying results. As per an analysis performed by Presti and Hart regarding several older trials, hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation have been shown to independently increase the risk of a thrombotic episode regardless of CHA2DS2-VASC score, particularly embolic events to the central nervous system early in the course of the disease. 30  In a large recent trial conducted in China by Chan et al., of 9727 Chinese patients with nonvalvular AF from July 1997 to December 2011, hyperthyroidism with atrial fibrillation was not known to independently increase the risk of thrombotic events with the risk for thrombosis based of the traditional risk factors outlined in the CHA2DS2-VASC score. 31  Two major recommendations are present regarding anticoagulation in those with atrial fibrillation and hyperthyroidism. As per the American College of Chest Physicians, hyperthyroidism was not found to be an independent risk factor of thrombosis in those with atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation should be based of the traditional CHA2DS2-VASC score. 31 ,  32  According to the American College of Cardiology however, hyperthyroidism independently increases the risk for development of stroke or thrombosis and patients should receive anticoagulation during the hyperthyroid phase regardless of CHA2DS2-VASC score. 33  In a study performed by de Souza and colleagues, in patients with hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation, a traditional CHADS2 score was used to predict who would benefit from anticoagulation with a subsequent TEE performed to assess the efficacy of the score in identifying possible thrombogenic milieu. In this study it was found that only age was an accurate predictor of thrombogenic milieu with the remaining risk factors having a low yield. 34  This study further delineates that the decision to initiate anticoagulation in patients who have hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation may ideally be done on an individual basis. In the majority of cases, the cause of hyperthyroidism is either secondary to autoimmune (graves) disease, toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma. The mainstay of treatment is B-blockade and treatment with an anti-thyroid agent (PTU or methimazole). While B-blocker therapy is first line to manage narrow complex tachyarrhythmias in the setting of thyrotoxicosis, in certain cases of tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy there may be a concern for hemodynamic compromise. In such cases a short acting B-blocker such as esmolol may be given to assess tolerability. 23  Digoxin may also be considered in those with a tenuous hemodynamic status. However, due to a few factors; increased renal clearance, increased sympathetic tone in atrial fibrillation with reduced vagal tone and a large volume of distribution of digoxin, a larger than usual dose of digoxin is required, thus caution must be used to avoid digoxin toxicity. 35 ,  36  In patient’s where B-blocker therapy is contraindicated, other management choices include calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem or verapamil. These agents should however be avoided in those with a reduced ejection fraction or hemodynamic instability due to a strong negative inotropic effect. Amiodarone may be used in the acute setting due to the benefit of converting the patient to normal sinus rhythm when combined with anti-thyroid medications such as PTU to reduce the chance of worsening thyrotoxicosis. 37  Caution must be used however due to the risk of atrial stunning and thrombogenic phenomenon if not properly anticoagulated. Regarding anticoagulation, at present, there is no consensus on the recommendation for anticoagulation during thyroid storm. Elevated thyroxine levels in thyroid storm are known to theoretically increase the risk of a thrombotic event secondary to a metabolic change that occurs in these patients namely: increased levels of Factor VIII, Factor IX, fibrinogen, vWF, plasminogen activator-inhibitor-1 and deficiency of antithrombin III with increased clearance of circulating heparin. 38 ,  39  The choice to anticoagulate patients in thyroid storm is per the clinician’s decision. Some clinicians choose to anticoagulate based of CHA2DS2-VASC score whereas others anticoagulate during the thyrotoxic phase regardless of other thrombotic risk factors. Rhythm control is usually not recommended in patients with hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation as nearly two-thirds of patients revert to normal sinus rhythm 8–10 weeks after achieving a euthyroid state. 40  In those patients who continue to remain in atrial fibrillation after achieving a euthyroid state, rhythm control may be an option however like the general atrial fibrillation population, rate control is usually preferred initially. Options for rhythm control include class IA, IC as well as class III agents. The use of amiodarone may be indicated acutely as mentioned above during a thyroid storm to restore sinus rhythm or for chronic therapy in those with atrial fibrillation refractory to rate control. While the use of amiodarone has not been clearly studied in those with thyrotoxic atrial fibrillation, amiodarone is known to cause hyperthyroidism as well as hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism secondary to amiodarone is known as amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) and has been further sub classified into two categories. AIT has an incidence of approximately 3% in North America with an incidence of 10% for those living in iodine-depleted areas. 41  AIT Type I occurs in patients with underlying thyroid disease wherein the iodine load from amiodarone therapy (75\\xa0mg of iodine per 200\\xa0mg oral tablet) results in increased production of T3 and T4 known as the Jod- Basedow phenomenon. 42  AIT Type 2 is secondary to an autoimmune destructive thyroiditis where in T3 and T4 is released from the thyroid gland. This is secondary to an elevated concentration of iodide from pharmacological therapy resulting in inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis and release of stored hormone from the thyroid gland known as the Wolf-Chaikoff effect. 43  AIT type 1 has a higher incidence in countries with iodine deficient regions whereas AIT type 2 is more common in iodine replete areas. 44 In a study performed by Czarnywojtek et al., in patients who were previously hyperthyroid and underwent radioactive ablation of the thyroid gland (presently euthyroid), the efficacy of administering radioactive iodine was assessed prior to initiating amiodarone therapy despite being euthyroid at the time of administration. As per this study the authors concluded that the use of preventive radioactive iodine in euthyroid patients who were previously hyperthyroid prior to chronic amiodarone therapy was found to reduce the incidence of thyrotoxicosis and subsequently help sustain sinus rhythm. Of note 5 patients required an additional dose of radioactive iodine during this study. 45  In another study performed by Kunii et al., the efficacy of Bepridil was tested in converting patients with atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm in those with and without co-morbid hyperthyroidism. The authors found that Bepidril was equally efficacious irrespective of thyroid status. 46  However, owing to the untoward effects of Bepidril such as the risk of Torsade de pointe, the drug has been banned in several countries and should be used cautiously. In patients with overt hyperthyroidism without atrial fibrillation, thyroid treatment is warranted to reduce the risk of this potential complication. Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism should be done in individuals older than 65 and with a TSH level of <0.1 mU/L. If the patient is less than 65 year-old and TSH >0.1, treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism should be done if the individual has symptoms or has other risk factors i.e. heart disease or bisphosphonate treatment. 1 ,  47 The prognosis of those with hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation has not been previously studied to our knowledge. However, identifying that hyperthyroidism is a causative factor of atrial fibrillation plays a crucial role in management as outlined above. Similarly, while the prevalence of hypothyroidism is significantly higher in those with atrial fibrillation when compared to hyperthyroidism, in a large study performed by Selmer et al. as mentioned above, routine follow up with patients after the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation showed that the incidence of hyperthyroidism was significantly higher when matched with those without a history of atrial fibrillation. 6  Thus while no current guidelines are available, routine screening with TSH levels after the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation may help with early detection of hyperthyroidism and decrease the risk of metabolic and cardiovascular side effects. Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia in the world with increasing prevalence with age. Causative factors are vast with differences in required management. In this review we focused on hyperthyroidism as a causative factor of atrial fibrillation as well as its prevalence in the population with atrial fibrillation. The goal of this review was to address several questions regarding the differences in management when co-morbid hyperthyroidism is present. The overall prognosis of having co-morbid hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation has not clearly been studied, however as the risk of recurrence is similar amongst the euthyroid and hyperthyroid groups, we are lead to believe the over all prognosis of hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation is similar to those with atrial fibrillation when matched for other variables. Further studies may be indicated to help guide management, however, this review aims to summarize the current major goals in the management of this population. None.'"
